		  <h2 style="text-align:left;color:black;">About this project</h2>
		  <p>Deathmatch Classic: Refragged is a fan remake/continuation of Deathmatch Classic, currently being developed by Concussion Studios.</p>
		  <p>My involvement is limited to a bit of artwork that I did. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@mtdvideos" rel="noopener" target="_blank">MTD</a>, a project lead at Concussion and my good friend, asked if I could make achievement icons for the game that would appear on steam. I accepted and while I'm not done with all of them, I've completed the first batch that I was tasked with making.</p>
		  <h2 style="text-align:left;color:black;">Process</h2>
		  <p>Everything began with MTD's ideas. He created a spreadsheet defining the criteria for earning each achievement. Each one had a unique name, and the idea for what the icon would actually look like was usually related to either the actual requirements of the achievement, or the just the name.</p>

			<figcaption>A small look at what the spreadsheet looked like</figcaption>
		  </figure>
		  <p>The plan was also to make them visually similar to this image used to represent the game:</p>
		  <figure>
		    <img src="/project-images/dmcr_process1.png" alt="a metal lambda character" style="width:45vmin; display:inline; max-width:790px;">

		  </figure>
		  <p>I got to work replicating the look of that image. I created a procedural texture in blender and ended up with a passable result.</p>
		  <figure>
		    <img src="/project-images/dmcr_process2.png" alt="a dark brown metal material" style="width:45vmin; display:inline; max-width:790px;">
			<figcaption>My complete recreation of the original logo</figcaption>
		  </figure>
		  <p>The next step was to make unique icons to put in the center. I wanted these to have that gold metal texture applied on top of them, so I figured I would have an easier time creating with vector graphics rather than raster. This would allow me to easily import the vector icons into blender and instantly apply a material over it. This is what drove the look of the icons into something more simple, as that was more ideal for the vector workflow. I settled on a style that took alot of inspiration from the Olympic pictograms.</p>

			<figcaption>Comparison</figcaption>
		  </figure>
		  <p>MTD would draw quick sketches to explain his ideas and I would try to make them. I streamed most of this process and the archived streams can be viewed on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLay8pjVzRxeO4DaztFQghMqLWBVu5Q5l2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">vod channel</a>.

		  </figure>
		  <p>I then made 51 of these using Inkscape.</p>
		  <figure>
		    <img src="/project-images/dmcr_process4.png" alt="50 black and white icons depicting various actions from the game" style="width:60vmin; display:inline; max-width:790px;">

		  </figure>
		  <p>These were then imported into Blender, where I gave them their texture and depth detail.</p>
		  <figure>
		    <img src="/project-images/dmcr_process5.png" alt="a finished textured icon depicting an action from the game" style="width:45vmin; display:inline; max-width:790px;">

			<figcaption>An example of a finished icon</figcaption>
		  </figure>
		  <p>The finished icons I'm showing are rendered at 1024x1024, but these are high resolution versions. The ones that will actually be used are rendered at a smaller 256x256.</p>

			<figcaption>Example of an icon at lower resolution</figcaption>
		  </figure>
		  <p>Some of the icons feature an additional blood texture. I drew some blood splatters in Autodesk Sketchbook for these.</p>
		  <figure>
		    <img src="/project-images/dmcr_process7.png" alt="red simple blood splatters" style="width:45vmin; display:inline; max-width:790px;">
			<figcaption>Blood splatters.</figcaption>
		  </figure>
		  <p>These were mixed into the image on an overlay layer.</p>

			<figcaption>Example of an icon featuring a blood splatter</figcaption>
		  </figure>
		  <p>But yeah I made 51, with the first one being locked achievement icon. It's desaturated unlike the others.</p>

		    <img src="/project-images/dmcr_process9.png" alt="all of the icons together" style="width:60vmin; display:inline; max-width:790px;">
			<figcaption>All current icons</figcaption>
		  </figure>
		  <p>As of right now, there are 50 more achievements planned. I'm taking a long break from working on these, and thankfully there isn't too much of a rush to finish these at the moment. Check out the game though. It's still in development but I'll list a couple ways to keep up with whats going on.
