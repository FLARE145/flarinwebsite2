		  <p>So as far as anyone can tell, this is my first furry drawing. That's pretty crazy when you think about it. I was alive for a whole 20 years before drawing furry art. What a life.</p>
		  <p>I drew most of this during a livestream but didn't finish it until after. It's funny how much effort I put into this. I haven't rendered in this style for over a year. Actually, I haven't spent more than a single sitting on anthing I've posted since 2022. I think the friendly sea boy was the last thing I actually spent time on. I guess I'm suprised I still got it? Idk I should get back into drawing some more finished stuff.</p>

		  <p>Anyways, Kimiko is a Fortnite skin. I've been playing a lot of Fortnite. My friend Rahim is usually using this skin so this is in reference to that. The shape in the background is a reference to the design on her forehead, which you can't see very well from this angle. I really wanted this to not come across as boring furry character against blank background. Some people through a colored square behind the character, which is fine, but I wanted it to be more involved I guess.</p>
