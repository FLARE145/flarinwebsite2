		  <h2>9/9/21 - bad vibes</h2>
		  <p>Haven't really gotten much work done on the animation. The main model is a bit further along and I have some stuff written, but I've mostly been focusing on school. The bad vibes come from the fact that I'm procrastinating on school. Even as I just wrote that last sentence, I heard thunder. Today is just giving off bad vibes man.</p>
		  <p>Oh I almost forgot, more bad vibes. My trusty bicycle that took me through high school is wounded. The crank arm has been loose for a while but it's now unusable. I took a look at it today and it turns out that the whole shaft was messed up. Buying the whole thing new is probably going to be like 40 bucks. I'm probably going to fix it instead of buying another used bike. It means a lot to me at this point so I feel like it deserves to have some money thrown at it.</p>
		  <p>It's not all bad though. This is all just unimportant in the long run. Whenever I run into a lot of little problems at once, it feels like too much, but I know that I'm complaining about nothing. I just need some time to take things in and set up action plans for everything. Being overwhelmed is what brings out my full potential. Working out usually helps with my stress, so I guess thats what I'm going to do next morning.</p>
		  <p>In fact, I'm just going to turn my health around again. It's been too long since I've done any running or training. It's time for me to regain my strength. Let it be known that I am begining a new redemption arc. I'm gonna kill the bad vibes, no matter the cost.</p>

		  <h2>9/6/21 - Really nice day</h2>
		  <p>I didn't have class today because of Labor Day, so I finally sort of got a break from catching up on school work. I enjoyed my freedom for a good chunk of the day, but the rest of my time was spent working on my newest project.</p>
		  <figure>

		  </figure>
		  <p>The model is still going to be worked on plenty, but this is a decent start. I hope that I can keep up the pace because rendering the video might take up more time than I would like it too. There's going to be a lot of stuff like glass, which will probably force me to render at higher samples.</p>
		  <p>I feel like I'm going to have a fun time working on this, even if I don't end up making the deadline.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="post">
		  <h2>9/5/21 - Work starting on new project</h2>
          <p>I'm still poop busy with school stuff, but plans for my next animation are in motion. I'm going to be making a fake trailer for a short film I wanted to make a while back.</p>
          <figure>
		    <img src="/blogimages/090521spaceship.png" alt="rough sketch of a spaceship'" style="width:60vmin; display:inline; max-width:790px;">
			<figcaption>Sketch from old concept art.</figcaption>
		  </figure>
		  <p>I hope I can do this idea justice. It was originally canceled because I couldn't come up with a satisfying conclusion to the story, but that wont be necessary for this fake trailer. The idea never went futher than my sketches.</p>
		  <p>Other random thing of note, the current Newgrounds banner has my Pico model on it. It features several models from the newgrounds 3d discord. Pretty cool.</p>

		  <h2>9/2/21 - Too cool for school</h2>
		  <p>Okay I'm actually not too cool for school but I needed a title. This post is just going to be a general update. We'll start with the most relevant stuff and go from there.</p>
		  <p>I have now surpassed 100 followers on Newgrounds! In celebration of this, I will be smiling today at 1:30 p.m. pst.</p>
		  <p>Also Newgrounds related, there is only one round left in the Summer Animation Jams. I think it starts tomorrow so hopefully I can get all of my homework done today.</p>
		  <p>Happy one month anniversary to the website, although I'm almost a week late on saying that. I haven't been posting as much because life has been a bit busy, and I think its reasonable to assume that this will continue. I'm trying to learn a bit of python to write a simple program that should make blog posts easier to make. It will mostly just serve as an excuse for me to learn python, kind of like how _______________ was an excuse for me to learn html + css.</p>
		  <p>And thats it for today. Gonna do some homework now.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="post">
		  <h2>8/22/21 - Completed stuff</h2>
		  <p>I've returned from time warping. I completed my collab entry a day earlier than planned, so thats nice to have out of the way. It was cool to work on that project overall, but it was unfortunetly caught in the middle of me being fairly busy. After that I knocked out my animation jam round 4 entry with more time left over than expected. Not by much though. I'm basically just free for this afternoon because I start school tomorrow. Still nice to feel free for moment though.</p>
		  <p>Alright other updates. My battle with search rankings seems to be over. This website finailly shows up on page one if you look up flare145. The only results that show up above it are my other accounts, which is perfect. I have no idea why it was tanking so hard after I initially started to improve the website. It legit went down to the 6th page of results at one point. Really weird.</p>
		  <p>Might stream soon if school doesn't get in the way. I've wanted to get back to it so hopefully that happens.</p>

		  <h2>8/18/21 - Time Warping</h2>
		  <p>I have two projects to complete in a very short amount of time. The biggest time constraint is my archnemesis: school. I start my first semester of uni in 5 days. This means that I can only reasonably allocate 2 days per project. This calls for some time warping.</p>
		  <p>Now you might be thinking, what is time warping? Is it even real? The answer is yes, and its called not sleeping. I can easily add 4 additional hours to every day I work by starting 2 hours earlier and stoping 2 hours later. Over 4 days, this becomes 16 additional hours. This is the kind of stuff high school actually teaches you.</p>

		  <p>The human mind shouldn't be capable of pulling off such a maneuver. I guess its a good thing that I lack one.</p>

		  <h2>8/16/21 - Cool relic</h2>
		  <p>Today I was cleaning my room and I found a comic I drew more than 2 years ago. This was for my first actual art class, which was a fun experience considering that I never thought my drawings would leave the margins of my notes.</p>
		  <figure>
		    <img src="/blogimages/081621comic.png" alt="A man places an apple on top of his friends head, preparing to shoot an arrow at the apple. After a loud splat, we see the archer seated at a dining table with someone else. 'Hey where's your friend?' 'Well umm...' He arrives and anounces, I made some apple pie.'" style="width:60vmin; display:inline; max-width:790px;">
			<figcaption>Photo of the comic, drawn on an 18x12" paper sheet.</figcaption>
		  </figure>
		  <p>Part of what makes this interesting is that I drew it before starting my now canceled webcomic. The webcomic was heavily story based, but it was going to have occasional light hearted spin off issues resembling this comic. Its also cool in that I had rarely drawn anything at this scale. Before this, I litterally only doodled on notes and index cards. I'll definitely post some of those eventually.</p>
		  <p>Now for actual news, work on my newest animation is going according to plan. It's nothing super special, but its nice to be working on collabs. Lot of cool folk out there.</p>

		  <h2>8/12/21 - The long post</h2>
		  <p>This is the post I've been afraid of. The large one. The big boy. The chungus I dare say. I've been trying to keep these nice and short, but I won't today. Mostly because I have to copy and paste in that comment I mentioned before, but also because I guess I got some FLARE145 related updates. Don't question the all caps, I just do that.</p>
		  <p>First up on the list, my weird common core YouTube comment. I mentioned this in the last blog post, and I'm going to try to give more context. I won't post a link to the video because I don't want to deal with it breaking or anything. The video was fairly new, and I think you could find it with the right amount of internet sleuthing. Anyways, I had no problems with what was said in the video. It was a really nice recap of the story of how U.S. education changed in response to students scoring lower than those in other nations. I'm not sure why I decided to comment. I guess I just find the topic interesting. It got a whopping eight likes so people must really like hearing my thoughts. Man sometimes I type stuff and realize why tone indicators exist. Here is the comment in full:</p>
		  <p>"I believe I was in fourth grade when I first started encountering common core. At the time, I didn't understand the controversy behind it. I was being told that my education was going to become more difficult for no good reason, and I believed it. I hated going to school because I was told that it had gotten worse. I'm now a high school graduate, and I have a better understanding of what actually happened. In retrospect, I think that I genuinely benefited a lot from common core. My parents never had the opportunity to go through proper education, so they were never going to be able to help me with my homework anyways. My siblings and I were already used to this, so the new curriculum didn't make that into a problem for me. Most of the stuff that people pointed out as nonsense useless explanations were really there to teach effective ways of thinking. I feel like I learned how to learn in a way that is much different than brute force memorization. It was also really interesting to see the push towards classroom collaboration. Especially in math, we worked in groups so often that it helped us to understand how to work with others and build off of each others ideas. The world could use a lot more of this collaborative attitude. I think its funny when people complain about how the American school system is an outdated relic from the industrial revolution, and then simultaneously complain about how common core is too different from the old ways of teaching. Common core was literally the evolution of teaching that people were asking for. Its a shame that it became such a controversial political issue. It tainted my experience at the time, and I wish I could have gone through school without anyone telling me that the government was working against me. Still, I'm glad that I actually learned at school instead of learning to memorize."</p>
		  <p>Man I just pasted that in and I do not want to read that. Well, onto whatever is next.</p>
		  <p>Thank you me. Next up is the story of my battle with google search. I want this site to appear when you search flare145 into google, but it never shows up on the first page of search results. I ended up registering my website in google's web optimization tools and it seemed like one of the problems was my lack of mobile compatibility. I had already tested mobile support and it worked fine, but I guess I didn't do it the proper way. I've since made more changes that fixed this, which actually lowered my google search ranking. I think this is because I removed a footer that said something like "flare 145 flare145 FLARE145." This was to increase searchability, and I think it worked? I had to get rid of it because the google optimization stuff said that the page had unreadable text, which was true. I made the footer impossible to actually see so that it just acted as tags. I have meta tags set up too, but they don't seem to work as well. I think removing the footer is what made my ranking go down, so now I'm going to correct it by saying FLARE145 once in a while. I've now done it five times in this post, so I think I'm doing pretty well.</p>
		  <p>I also want to mention again that more stuff is supposed to be on the website. It just won't be for a while. My hope is that the blog page becomes the most boring part of the site, but until then, little style changes will probably keep occurring. This page especially looks a bit different, and no I will not describe it to future proof this post. You just had to be there to see it.</p>
		  <p>And now back to vanity. Or maybe not vanity but... I don't actually know. More me centered stuff I guess. Maybe I would call this the boring part but I'm not sure the rest of the post was interesting enough for me to make that distinction. Anyways, I'm talking about the laptop again. This has obviously been a fan favorite topic that even captures the attention of the dead. I hopefully will be bringing it up less often now because I finally dropped it off to get shipped yesterday. That is all.</p>
		  <p>Well, this has been a long post. I'm actually typing this into google docs instead of directly into the html file like I usually do. Wow I've probably mentioned google more than FLARE145	 now. Haha managed to sneak in two more flare145s. Anyways, I think posts should remain short for three reasons. First, this giant block of text looks too daunting to read, and while I don't care if people read it or not, it bugs me that even I would never want to read this. Second, this is going to look really weird in the html for me. And third, idk i forgor :|</p>

		  <h2>8/10/21 - Chill day</h2>
		  <p>Today was a nice day. I was waiting for an other email related to laptop thing so I just drew for a while and watched some YouTube. Hopefully I can get the laptop sent out tomorrow or the day after.</p>
		  <p>I made a somewhat heated comment on YouTube today. Or at least it felt heated in the moment. I was watching a video about the common core curriculum and I have some opinions on how it affected American education. I think I'll copy and paste it into a blog post soon because it might be interesting.</p>
		  <p>If everything goes according to plan, I should be spending most of tommorrow working on my collab animation I've been neglecting. I'm hoping I can knock it out this week but my gut is saying that it will take longer.</p>
		</div>
		<div class= "post">
		  <h2>8/9/21 - Don't want to school</h2>
		  <p>Looks like I'm going to be able to return the laptop. Different departments of the manufacturing company said conflicting things about my warranty, and it took way too long for everything to get sorted out. What an awful experience.</p>
		  <p>In other news, I'm currently dreading going to university. I didn't get as much financial aid as I had hoped, so I feel guilty for going because it seems like a waste of money. Mostly because I chose to be an art major, and that seems to be like one of the worst degrees you can get. Or at least they don't have quite the same value as some other degrees. I wish I could just take a year off and work on my own stuff to build up a nice portfolio. Maybe I'll just drop out or something. Unless I get better financial aid next year. It would be better for me to stay if that were the case.</p>
		  <p>It's weird how much teachers believed in my potential for success. I wish I could tell them all that I have no idea what I'm doing with my life and that I've always been no different from anyone else. Or maybe they already knew that. </o>

        <div class= "post">
		  <h2>8/6/21 - Things falling apart</h2>
		  <p>The laptop is defective. The headphone jack doesn't work and the usb ports aren't capable of transfering data. I spent a large chunk of my day dealing with customer support hell. I know it's a hardware issue because I've tried every conceivable driver fix. I'm disappointed.</p>
		  <p>This is the last in a string of events that have wasted too much of my time, and I've made the call to cancel my next animation to prevent me from overworking myself. I'm not looking forward to making a more public post about this, but I'm sure everyone will understand.</p>
		</div>
		<div class= "post">
		  <h2>8/5/21 - Laptop</h2>
		  <p>I bought a laptop for school this fall, and it arrived today. While computer upgrades came from my money, this is technically bought from my parents money because they are going help with school expenses. The excitement of setting up a new device has eaten away at more of my time, but its worth it because it should make me more productive in the long run. Mostly because I can work on things in more places, but it will also serve as a good machine to remotely control my computer. I've also cloned my repositories so I can make posts to this website from the laptop, which is what I'm doing right now. Really convenient I think.</p>
		  <p>This morning I was playing minesweeper and I won two games with the same time.</p>

		  <p>I think this might be the fastest I've beaten it too, which is sad when you think about how much I've played minesweeper.</p>

		  <h2>8/4/21 - Time wasting</h2>
		  <p>I've gotten incredibly good at wasting time. I'm supposed to be animating for the animation jam, but I guess I have very low expectations of this one because I can't seem to stay focused for more than 30 minutes at a time. I almost fell asleep 3 times today so thats cool for time. I was actually listening to a podcast today where the hosts were discussing different forms of time wasting and it felt super relevant to my life. Fun coincidence. At least I'm still getting work done, even if its slow.</p>

		  <h2>8/3/21 - All the Newgrounds love</h2>
		  <p>Man I'm really happy my stuff is doing well on Newgrounds. My newest animation got first place in the second round. Summer Animation Jams. I got seventh on the previous round, so I'm currently second place in total. I don't think I'll score well on the next one, but depending on the themes of the future rounds, I have a shot at keeping top ten.</p>
		  <p>Also my previous animation got frontpaged seemingly out of nowhere. That means that so far, I've gotton two art posts featured and two videos featured. I guess Newgrounds staff think I fit in. I mostly have BrandyBuizel to thank for my bit of success. He's championed my work quite a bit and I will never forget that.</p>
		  <p>I've now got a total of 59 fans on Newgrounds, making it my largest following on the internet. I hope that they enjoy my more orginal stuff when it comes out.</p>
		</div>
		<div class= "post">
		  <h2>8/1/21 - Website plans</h2>
		  <p>Right now, there are only 3 pages, being the landing, links, and blog pages. I plan on having a projects page that showcases work thats gone into my previous projects. Or something like that. It would become a lot more interesting once I get to work on personal projects that I've been wanting to work on for a while now. Not sure when that will happen because school and life, but one day I'll get around to it. I also might make a gallery page, which will act as a previous work portfolio sort of thing.</p>
		</div>
		<div class= "post">
		  <h2>7/31/21 - First "post"</h2>
		  <p>So this page is going to become my official blog. This website is still very much a work in progress, but its been a fun little thing to work on. This is the grand sequel to my old google sites page which I made back when I was like 11.</p>
		  <figure>
		    <img src="/blogimages/theflarinwebsite.png" alt="screenshot of outdated looking website" style="width:45vmin; max-width:790px;">
			<figcaption>A screenshot of my old website, which I had named "the flarin website"</figcaption>
		  </figure>
		  <p>I'm not sure what I'll do exactly with this page. It's mostly here as an homage to the news page on the original website, but It might be fun to post wip stuff from my projects. Not many people will actually see this, so I can probably talk about spoiler-ish stuff related to whatever I'm currently working on. So yeah. Come back once a year or something to see what I've been up too. It might be more interesting than the kind of stuff I put on twitter.</p>
