          <h2>2/22/22 - TWOSDAY part two</h2>
          <p>Oh my god its real. It's a real Twosday miracle! Two blog posts in one day! Double posts are not supposed to be scientifically possible. It has never happened and will likely never happen again. I'm in shock. So this is the true power of Twosday spirit.</p>
          <p>So I talked about my musical experiment last week, and today you can listen to it. Just click the following text: <a href="https://flare145.com/flarehost/musicpreview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I revoke ownership of my soul</a> to check it out. That link might break someday and I will be too lazy to fix it. It should work for a long time though.</p>
          <p>Now what do I fill this second post with. Oh, the winter Olympics ended. I have now purpose now... Just kidding, only <i>two</i> more years until Paris 2024 baby! </p>
          <p>Another interesting fact about today is that it has now been a whole year since Daft Punk disbanded. It seems like there's rumors of a comeback but I don't care enough to pay attention to that stuff. I'd be perfectly content if they never came back, but it would still be awesome if they did return. That little video they did last year hit really hard, so I feel like their return might undermine some of that significance. Gonna go rewatch it after this so I can cry.</p>
          <p>That's all for this twice in a lifetime event. I hope you have a great rest of your Twosday.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="post">
          <h2>2/22/22 - TWOSDAY</h2>
          <p>Guys I was wrong about that other day, today is the real Twosday! The date is 2/22/22 and it lands on a Tuesday! You could also interpret this to mean that there are two Twosdays, and that makes total sense honestly. </p>
	      <p>I am currently typing this during genetics because I have no idea what is going on. Actually you know what, I should really pay attention to this class.</p>
          <p>Okay class is over now and I still have no idea what is going on. Anyways, today I got <i>two</i> things to talk about. Haha get it?</p>
          <p>First is that I have been up to nothing. I have not created anything of value lately. School is keeping me busy so progress on everything is so slow that it isn't worth mentioning.</p>
          <p>But I have some good news too. Streams are back and they are weekly. I started my playthrough of Half-Life 2 last week and it was fun. Streams are on Wednesdays at 5:00 so be there or be square. Hmmm... I just got an idea for the website. I might but a little advertisement for my weekly streams somewhere.</p>
          <p>Man, if only there were something like a Twosday miracle. I could really us a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now...</p>
        </div>

          <h2>2/15/22 - Lil music thingy</h2>
          <p>Back in November, I procrastinated on an assignment so hard that I accidently made a whole song instead. I don't like using the word song to describe it because it doesn't have lyrics, but I don't know what else to call it. It's a three minute track that I put together using LLMS. Unfortunately, I have no idea what to do with it now.</p>
          <p>I had planned to put it up on Newgrounds during December, but I didn't manage to clean it up in time. It wasn't until recently that I even remembered that it existed. I gave it a fresh listen and honestly, I think it's pretty good. There's still some issues with it but I don't feel comfortable with just letting it go to waste. I think it deserves to go along with something. Like a music video or short game or something idk. That sounds like too much work though. Maybe I'll make a ton of them and release an album? That also sounds like a ton of work. I think that for now, I will just post it to this website somehow. Maybe it will be a secret link for the people who read this. Though I will definitely take it down once it has a purpose.</p>
          <p>In other news, I might be working on a new animated collab? I say might because I haven't committed to it yet. I'm not sure that I have the time to say yes to these things anymore. Could be fun though. If I ever agree to do it, I will mention it here.</p>
          <p>I've got one final update today regarding streaming. I've mentioned before that I'd like to stream weekly, but I still can't guarantee that I will. I would have started this week but I think I might have a lot of work to do tomorrow so I'm calling it off for now. If I do manage to get a weekly stream thing going, the plan is Wednesdays at 5:00 PM (PST). I'm guessing that I would only have the energy for short streams, so no six hour extravaganzas anytime soon. Only one to two hour streams. Hopefully I will be starting Half-Life 2 but if I don't feel like it, I will just stream some drawing.</p>
          <p>Thankfully I am done for the day so I get to relax for a few hours right now. Gonna lay down and watch an animal life documentary so bye.</p>

          <h2>2/14/22 - Dangerous object</h2>
          <p>I teased this story at the end of the last post. I meant to post this last week but life. Here is my funny bomb story. For legal reasons, bomb is hyperbole.</p>
          <p>So my brother had this unusable laptop that he repurposed as a home server. Its main purpose was to host a Minecraft server but it also ran a bot that I would use to auto play music on my live streams. This laptop found its glorious new purpose as the <i>Server Boi</i>. But that was two years ago.</p>
          <p>Two weeks ago, my brother had become tired of the loud sound it made. He had put the laptop in a cardboard box and hid it behind a desk in order to keep it out of the way. He wanted to do something about the loud sound so he unplugged it. He opened the box and found that the laptop had grown in thickness. The battery had been inflating. </p>
          <p>Anyone familiar with this stuff should know that this is not a good thing. Actually even everyone unfamiliar should assume that as well. The dang battery can explode. Not like a cool big explosion but you know, that... scary sort of pop thing. So yeah. He got it properly disposed of now. That's the story of how I slept next to a bomb. Well, there was an entire wall in between me and the battery but still.</p>
          <p>Most of this post was written a week ago, so this is bit will be a short acknowledgement of the present day. It is valentines day ha ha haha haHa HaHaHa HAHAHAHAHAHAHA... I am okay. </p>
          <p>I gotta get back to the grind now. The world needs to get its butt kicked and I don't see anyone else rising up to the occasion. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="post">
          <h2>2/7/22 - Meh</h2>
          <p>I've been doing the school stuff. Much better start than last semester. I really screwed that up by trying to do so much at once. I hope that never happens again.</p>
          <p>Anyways I've been up to quite a bit besides the school stuff. There's a new project I've been working on that I believe I mentioned last time. Its not anything like an animation. In fact its much lamer than an animation. Its been fun to work on though so hopefully I can finalize the details soon so that I can talk about it in depth.</p>
          <p>All other projects are still temporarily dead. Trust me I will talk about them again as soon as I get to work on them again.</p>
          <p>Lastly, take care of yourselves. I know its only February but this year has been kind of rough no? Maybe thats just me but I'm sure most of you could relate. Remember to treat yourself every once in a while.</p>
          <p>See you next time where I'll be telling the story of the bomb sitting in the room next to me. I am kidding but only halfway. This story is wacky.</p>

          <h2>2/2/22 - Infiltrating the Internet</h2>
          <p>Okay so remember the whole thing I was talking about last post? Well turns out the rabbit hole goes much much deeper.</p>
          <p>I'm actually not going to go into detail about what I've discovered, but it has greatly changed my perspective on the internet. My plan to improve my searchability has reached a halt. I might get in to some light trouble if I continue doing what I was doing, so I'm going to stop for now. I'm still going to keep researching though. Trying to get a better understanding of the full picture. I know this whole thing reads strange and overdramatic, but I have no other words to convey what I'm talking about without being harmfully specific? Maybe I'm being too conscious by saying that it's information that could be harmful. I probably sound like an idiot to anyone who actually knows what's going on. You know what skrew it, I'm gonna tell you guys the whole story once I get to the bottom of this.</p>
          <p>Also you might be wondering how I'm writing this post when I am supposedly busy with schoolwork...   Moving on</p>
          <p>Just kidding. Art projects are essentially halted at the moment but I get time here and there to mess around. It's not enough time for focused work on bigger projects, but its enough to at least develop some smaller ideas. I'll talk about one of these ideas soon because I think it might be important to the future of this whole internet infiltration thing. Yes I lied earlier, I'm still secretly trying to increase my searchability. The difference is that this method will be much slower. Anyways, this small idea isn't really art related or anything, its just boring. It sounds weird when I describe it like that but it will all make sense later.</p>
          <p>Also today is twosday. 2/2/22. I thought I would mention that because yeah. Funny looking day is funny looking. I don't know what I'm saying anymore. Sorry to all future people who are reading this. Actually no, if you are from the future and reading this, you deserve this boredom. Get out of here and go live a life. Trust me, you aren't gaining much from reading the pretentious words of an ancient failure. Okay, now back to my people in the present. Hello thanks people from the present. Yall are cool for supporting me and stuff. Happy twosday to you.</p>
          <p>Phew I just wrote way more than I expected to write today. Some of these get pretty long now. So long</p>

          <h2>2/1/22 - Learning the system</h2>
          <p>Okay back to business. I've been experimenting with what is known as the google knowledge graph. I'm going to make it so that google is aware of FLARE145 as an entity. Specifically a person. The point is that it might be possible for me to force google into creating one of those informational panels about me. I don't even care all that much about having one, but the idea of being able to do all of that by myself is what drives me. </p>
          <p>At the moment, I have made the first steps towards achieving this goal, but there is still no sign of me existing on the knowledge graph. This gives me approximately three more days to figure out my next move, seeing as my site gets crawled around every three days. Google search results also take a bit to update properly, so the status of this whole operation might change even sooner. If I manage to pull this off, I'm going to be slightly more worried about the validity of information on the web. Also if I pull it off, I totally deserve that knowledge panel.</p>
          <p>I gots to get a good nights rest now for school. See you in the next episode of <i>FLARE145 Conquers the Internet!</i></p>

          <h2>1/31/22 - Another personal one</h2>
          <p>I actually have gone back to work on my artwork from December so I'm happy about that. I still have no idea when that will be done but I hope people like it when I post it.</p>
          <p>So recently I watched the Disney show Loki. It was really good actually. The only other new mcu show I've seen is Wandavision and they have both raised my expectations for the rest of the new stuff. I'm gonna talk about spoilers now so just stop reading this post if you care. The show deals with the concept of branching timelines. One event can occur in different ways, creating alternate strings future events. What I find creative about this show's interpretation is that they introduce an organization responsible for destroying all timelines but one, which they call the sacred timeline. They eliminate variants, the name given to people who break free of the sacred events. Now why have I explained all of this?</p>
          <p>I feel like a variant. I know how stupid that sounds but let me break it down. First, I don't actually believe branching timelines are a real thing, they are just a fun idea. What I mean by my statement is that recently, I've been feeling like I've made some kind of future altering decision, but I can't pin point a specific decision. I just feel like something is off. Maybe not bad necessarily, but definitely sad in some way. It's only a strange made up feeling though. Everything in my life is fine and the future is something we can't control easily. If this whole thing makes me sound unwell or insane, that is not the case. I find it fun to explore funky thoughts and I thought this feeling would be an interesting one to describe. </p>
          <p>If you read that whole thing, take a moment to question if it was worth it. Maybe you weren't supposed to read that, and you've now broken free from the sacred timeline. Goodbye for now, variant friend.</p>

          <h2>1/28/22 - Okay things are okay</h2>
          <p>I'm going to start by apologizing for this more personal post. I always try to prioritize talking about my creative work because that's what I want this blog to be for the most part. However, I throw these in because my life effects my work and also because I like to indulge my vanity sometimes.</p>
          <p>All I wanted to say today is that school went better than I thought it would, which is really nice. Makes me feel a bit better about life. If I like the stuff I make for this semester's art class, I'll probably post it here. Unfortunately these works will use up all of my creative free time, but the reward of improving as an artist is worth it.</p>
          <p>Still, I can't wait until summer. I can't wait to get back to working on entertaining stuff.</p>
        </div>
		<div class="post">
          <h2>1/27/22 - Sad before the storm</h2>
          <p>I'll start by going over some quick website news. I've optimized the art page by using heavily compressed image previews instead of loading the all of the full images at once. The downside is that the pop up images load in slower. It was worth it though because performance was bad on mobile usually. It's still not perfect but its much less noticeable now. </p>
          <p>You know I was about to go onto the next thing but no, this website thing is actually kind of interesting so here's some numbers you might not understand. Time to interactive went from 5.1 seconds to 1.7 seconds. The largest image previously loaded at 29.8 seconds but now loads at 1.4 seconds. The total size of the images hosted on that page went from 19.7 MB to 46.7 KB. Massive gains.</p>
          <p>Yeah uhhhh I didn't really have anything else to talk about actually. Well except for the fact that I will be less active again because of school and other stuff. This moment feels very Sunday to me. Sunday is the saddest day because its followed by Monday. I'm sure that makes sense. But yeah less of everything from now on. I wish I could have made better use of my free time but oh well. I guess I wasn't up for the grind this time.</p>
          <p>Oh I just remembered something. I am considering doing a strictly weekly stream though. I will have to play out a few weeks of school to figure out when would be best, but if I don't end up working this semester than I might do that. I liked that I was doing most of my streams recently at a consistent time so expanding that out into specific days could work. Of course there will be days where I just don't feel like it, and I wouldn't stream in that case. I thought it was nice to be streaming so often this past month, so this idea is the best I could come up with to keep that feeling alive.</p>
          <p>Do not stay tuned because I will probably disappear but who knows. If my life can turn to garbage in the blink of an eye, than surely it can get better just as fast. Take care</p>

          <h2>1/26/22 - Random new art</h2>
          <p>So progress on everything is going very slow, but at least I posted something to Newgrounds today. I suddenly started drawing this like two days ago and I've put it up today. Check out the <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/art/view/flare145/i-do-not-care-at-this-point" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full artwork</a>.</p>
          <p>Whoooo I think that's the first time I've linked something on the blog. Hopefully that link never breaks. In the future I hope to be able to link to the artwork hosted on this site, but at the moment it lacks descriptions and stuff. </p>
          <p>So yeah no real blog post today. Your homework is to click the link and look at my art. I put a cool picture on there that shows the development of the drawing so I hope that is something interesting to see.</p>
        </div>
		<div class="post">
          <h2>1/24/22 - uhh look concept art</h2>
          <p>Here is a low res look at the concept for my current animation project.</p>
          <figure>
            <img src="/blogimages/012422rainbow.png" alt="A drawing of a man and a rainbow" style="width:60vmin; display:inline; max-width:790px;">
            <figcaption>A sketch of the new main character</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>This animation should be very short. Like we're talking somewhere around 10 seconds. It's still gonna take a while though because I'm trying to make the character rig easily reusable.</p>
          <p>I would have made a longer blog post but I don't feel like it right now. I'm up later than usual because I lost track of time while drawing a different thing. So yeah. I'll talk more about this project later but bye for now</p>
        </div>
        <div class="post">
          <h2>1/17/22 - Catching up more</h2>
          <p>Wow another blog post already? Crazy I know. Just gonna mention stuff that didn't make the cut last time.</p>
          <p>First thing to address: What happened to that new artwork I was working on? So I haven't worked on it since I last showed it on here but its super close to being done. I just haven't worked on it because I'm working on bigger things instead.</p>
          <p>Speaking of bigger stuff, what's the progress on Railcar Wrestle? So oof yeah this one is canceled. Well more like pushed back. I knew I probably shouldn't have mentioned it when I did but hey, the blog is the place where I get to talk about early development stuff so that's bound to happen. This animation is still going to happen, but its now going to be part of a different even bigger project. I'm doing a smaller animation test instead. This smaller animation will 3d blank boi. I'm going to be testing the rig that is essentially the foundation for most of my future projects. Here's a sample model.</p>
          <figure>
            <img src="/blogimages/011722blankmodel.png" alt="A 3d model of a blank figure." style="width:45vmin; display:inline; max-width:790px;">
            <figcaption>Work in progress blank boi model wearing additional clothing.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>The clothing is a quick test of what further designed characters could look like. I will show more progress on this rig as it develops. Next blog post might feature the concept art for the specific character I need to make for the small animation test.</p>
          <p>Thinking about posting more progress on social media. I don't expect anyone to read this blog so it would be nice if it looked like I was actually working on something. But yeah I'll be back with more updates soon so until then, stay gamer gamers.</p>
        </div>

          <h2>1/15/22 - FLARE145 in 2022</h2>
          <p>Yo haven't written since last year. This is absolutely not because I'm busy. I just wanted the first blog post to be a little special. I gave up though so all you get is this.</p>
          <p>I wanted to have like a cool teaser of stuff I have planned, but I'm literally just a guy doing this in spare time so I can't be sure about what will actually come out this year. I have cool stuff planned but I can only guarantee one animation to release. It's fairly short and I'm working on it right now.</p>
          <p>So what have I been doing then? Streaming. Tons of streaming. I think this might have been the densest period of streaming I've ever had, although that rate is already quickly diminishing. I had a lot of time and I wanted to check Spore off of my backlog so I did like four streams. There will be a fifth but the end of the game is so dang long that I'm playing most of it off stream. There will eventually be a highlight video edited by MTD Videos so that means the YouTube finally gets another crumb of content. I think this one will be pretty fun.</p>
          <figure>
            <img src="/blogimages/011522drive.png" alt="an image of a usb drive with the flare 145 logo painted on it" style="width:45vmin; display:inline; max-width:790px;">
            <figcaption>The FLARE145 usb drive</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>Not providing context for that so uh that's the update for now. I hope to keep making stuff throughout the year so lets see how this goes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="post">
          <h2>12/31/21 - Last day of the year</h2>
          <p>Honestly kinda depressing how fast the year has gone by. Its crazy to think about projects I've worked on because so many of them are starting to seem like a good while ago. Trinket Trouble was already a whole year ago. I started my failed webcomic two years ago. Doesn't feel like that long. Though sometimes it does feel like forever ago so maybe it just depends on my mood.</p>
          <p>Anyways I have cool news today. I finally linked the art page! I finished drawing the icon this morning. I think I'm going to tweak all of the icons a bit more because they're a little jank, but I'm still happy with how things look right now. I probably won't be working on the website much anymore. Like there is still a lot I'd want to do, but none of them are of priority to me. I guess the next big thing would be the projects page, but that seems like a lot of work. I'll talk about that more whenever I decide to make it.</p>
          <p>I've been streaming a decent amount and its been fun. I beat Half-Life Blue Shift so now I can finally start Half-Life 2. I probably wont for a bit though. I'm thinking of playing through spore on stream soon. Stream stuff is fun but sometimes I wish I could do more stupid streams again. Stuff like when I just did my homework. I want to read a whole book on stream but I don't want to force anyone to watch that. Maybe I'll do that in secret. I have been thinking about what else might be entertaining to watch and I have a few ideas I'm going to try soon.</p>
          <p>I've gotten a decent amount of work done on my next artwork. It's looking pretty cool, although I still won't be done with it for another while. I want it to look perfect, so I'm taking my time. I haven't been putting images often so here you go. An actual work in progress pic.</p>

            <figcaption>A low res render of my progress so far.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>Moving on uhhhh, I forgot what else I was going to talk about. It's been an okay year for all of the creative endeavors and I hope to carry that through into 2022. See you all next year.</p>

          <h2>12/25/21 - Christmas 2021</h2>
          <p>I've been mostly silent despite school being out (wooooo) but thats because Christmas stuff has taken up my time. After tomorrow I will pretty much be a free man.</p>
          <p>So, let's do a dang blog post. First topic: I'm writing this on my phone? Now that my blog writing tool is hosted online, I can just use my phone to write a post and paste it into the site later. Pretty neat.</p>
          <p>In terms of what I've managed to do recently, I've gotten work done on a few things. I worked on the icon for my art page and I worked on some achievement icons for a friend of mine. I live streamed my progress on these so that was fun. Even did another stream soon after that as well. I'm not sure if the frequency of streams will remain this high but thats the plan.</p>
          <p>Oh yeah and Christmas was fun too. Got to do more social stuff now that plenty of people at least have the vaccine. I got some snow pants that I needed and regular pants that were not as needed. Got sunglasses, gloves, pj's, and a new pair of vans. I'm happy with this stuff. The gloves might be the most exciting thing to me. I have a small glove collection with gloves of different uses. The new ones are sort of fingerless sport gloves. I'll probably use them for skating in the summer. Oh I also got some dark chocolate peanut butter cup thingys and they're super good. I guess I'll end this segment by saying merry Christmas to you, the reader. There is a very small chance that you actually read this on the day I post it but whatever.</p>
          <p>This coming week im probably gonna make more blog posts. Not sure what about, but there will be more. Probably just spam really. Hopefully I stream often and get the priority projects done. I might even begin working on other stuff before I finish because I'm more motivated about those things.</p>
          <p>Well that about does it for today. Or tonight. Tonight sounds cooler. I should say that more often. Thank you for reading this garbage. You have no reason to other than the occasional project teasers. Hmmmmm... I wonder what I'll tease next...</p>

          <h2>12/15/21 - huh what</h2>
          <p>All my exams are taking up my time because a majority are actually essays. I've given myself a decent amount of time to relax though. I haven't worked on anything for myself this week so I actually have free time. Spent it looking at memes. Got two more classes to get finished up and then I'm free >:)</p>

          <h2>12/10/21 - Game awards 2021</h2>
          <p>Game awards happened and it was okay. It Takes Two won and that's entirely fair. In terms of world premieres, I think the Sonic game was the most interesting thing for me personally. Every time a new Sonic game is revealed it looks cool, but it always ends up being kinda meh. I was really hoping to see the Breath of The Wild sequel but it didn't show up. Maybe January Nintendo Direct will have it. I can't think of anything else to mention and if I remember something later, I won't bother to share my thoughts.</p>
          <p>Website updates. I'm now hosting my blog writing tool on the website because its more convenient for me. It's quicker than running the python http server every time. I've also made some changes to the art page. Clicking on a picture is supposed to link you to a separate page with more information about it, but I've now removed that functionality. This is just because it's not quite ready. I haven't input all of the info on the pictures yet and I likely won't for a good while. With this change, I'm fully prepared to link it to the main page. I really just need to finish the icon for it.</p>
          <p>Quick life check-in, I'm doing fine. I've got finals next week and after that I'm set. </p>
          <p>Now for actual creative things. I've worked a bit more on that artwork I mentioned in the last blog post. I would post a screenshot of it so far but I actually can't right now. I'm writing this on the laptop but my actual pc is currently frozen pretty bad. I was working on a thing in blender and I did a stupid. I can force close blender but I didn't save my work and I don't want to lose it, so I'm sort of waiting it out. So yeah, maybe I'll show a screenshot next time but definitely not today. I've also done a bit more concept development on the big project and I'm very happy with it so far. Something I'll have to do for this next project is create a definitive blank boi rig. I'm going to spend a long time making sure it's good, so I'll be happy to show it off when that is complete.</p>
          <p>That's all for today. I'm gonna try to get my computer working again. I'd like to be actually working on something right now. Ok bye</p>

          <h2>12/3/21 - Idk what happening anymore</h2>
          <p>I got finals coming up and its a bit stressful. I'm good at distracting myself to calm myself down but I'm not sure that's what I should be doing right now.</p>
          <p>So what have I been up to creatively? Unfortunately not much. Recently I've just been doodling during some classes so I guess that's nice. I've been occasionally working on a new artwork that sort of goes along with my series I put out this year. It's the same sort of 2d drawing + 3d environment thing that I've experimented a lot with. I'm not sure when I'll get done with it. I think I streamed myself working on it for a bit so that was fun. Maybe I'll stream more during the break. I'm hoping that during the winter break I can make something, but I might just want to actually take a real break for once. It would be nice to get a real break from everything but I'm not sure that I'm capable of that anymore. </p>
          <p>Okay website stuffs. Checking right now and it seems I haven't made any changes in 28 days. Last blog post 13 days ago. Search ranking at 15. Yeah I haven't been paying any attention to this recently. I probably wont be for a while. Next objective is still just linking the art page on the main page. Still working on the icon for it. Also I've considered restructuring the site  to have a "other" page that contains the blog and settings pages. I'll talk more about that later if I decide to do it.</p>
          <p>YouTube update! Have I ever had anything to say about my YouTube on here? Wait yes actually, and this is related. So I said a while back that I wanted to rename some of my videos, and if my memory serves me correct I finally did this a week or two ago. I'm probably gonna update some of the thumbnails too. In terms of what I'm making next on there, I still have plans of doing the behind the scenes videos of all my new animations. Again, not sure when any of that is going to happen. Other than that, nothing planned for the YouTube.</p>
          <p>Future future stuff! I don't know why I did the exclamation marks this time. Its not really fitting. I just wanted to talk about what I would like to do next as a big boy project. I guess the last big boy project would have been the canceled Starcoin. I'm letting that project rest for now. It will see the light of day again, but for now I'd like to get more experimental. I see Starcoin working as a 10 minute movie, and I know that I'm not capable of that yet. So, I'm currently "working" on a concept for a new short. I can't give a lot away (because there isn't even much developed yet) but I want this to be my attempt at something more action flavored. If I make more progress on the concept, I'll post it here. So yeah, this is sort of the unofficial announcement of my next banger, Railcar Wrestle. That is the working title or codename that I would prefer not to say because this idea is still in super duper baby phase but I don't care anymore. If I cancel it, it can become obscure flare145 lore. Maybe I will just reference it all the time but never make it. Oh wait I guess that's what Starcoin is for now.</p>
          <p>Oh boy well this was a juicy one I think. I was writing this in class as I typically do, but class is over now so I should stop now. Remember kids, if you have no time to do everything you want, just start multitasking. It totally wont lower the quality of your work or your relationships with other people. OH wait wait</p>
          <p>Newgrounds Winter Festival! I'm sticking with the exclamation marks baby! So actually I was hyped for this because I thought it was going to happen during my break, but I looked it up after typing the last sentence and I was wrong. Its happening the day I start classes again. :( Well It was fun to be excited for a second there. I had been considering trying to do a panel for it but I guess that isn't going to happen now. I'm sure it will still be cool though and I'll try to experience it in any way I can. </p>
          <p>Okay now this is really over. I have to say goodbye. You know I really like talking to the void. Its awesome. I am never adding a comment system to this because it would ruin the vibe. Anyways, if you read this whole thing you are messed up and should probably go touch grass. Until next time losers.</p>

          <h2>11/20/21 - Thanksgiving Inbound</h2>
          <p>Ok I said that I would post some new drawings, but I'm literally too lazy to take nice pictures of them to host on here. Maybe I'll do that later.</p>
          <p>With that out of the way, what have I been up to? Not a lot really. Schoolwork got a bit heavier again so I stopped working on the website for about 2 weeks. However, it was during this time that I found my Dsi. I had been searching for it over the last few months and I was convinced I had lost it. I backed up all the data on it and proceeded to mod it. There is an art post on my newgrounds titled "Moving Day" which goes into more detail about the what I did with the modded device. </p>
          <p>I might make another blog post tomorrow going over a few more updates, but for now I want to the sleep so bye</p>

          <h2>11/6/21 - Art page coming along nicely</h2>
          <p>The page is looking good except mobile viewing is still a bit weird. Don't know if I'll be able to fix it. Honestly I would link it on the main page already but I still need to make the icon for it. Also it would be nice if I got the text descriptions done before that as well.</p>
          <p>Other news, I really gotta get some homework done so blog posts shall go back to being infrequent. Or maybe not. They might just get really weird again. Or you know what, maybe I can post some doodles. </p>
          <p>It's settled. If I remember to take pictures of them, I'll start posting some things I've drawn recently.</p>

          <h2>11/5/21 - This is now a dev log</h2>
          <p>Well not really, but you know what I mean. I make these posts when I'm working on stuff I can talk about and I'm working on stuff right now. </p>
          <p>Uhhhhh... I'm actually pretty tired right now so I don't remember what I wanted to write about today. Hmmmmm... I worked on the art page more and it looks really good, but I still need to add the 'see details' functionality. Also I need to design the button you click to get to the page, and I have no idea what to make it look like. Currently the page is actually live on the website through /art, so go there if you want to see it while it's still unfinished. </p>
          <p>Bro I actually am tired though so I'm gonna stop the post right here. Not even gonna finish this sente</p>

          <h2>11/4/21 - Blog tool mostly done</h2>
          <p>I've finished adding all the functionality I said was missing from my blog post writing tool. Now that that's done, today I started work on what I should have done a long time ago. I'm working on an actual art page.</p>
          <p>The plan is to have a grid of images that you can click on and see details about. Each piece an informational blurb as well as links to everywhere its been posted. At the moment, I'm not very far into development, but it's still looking pretty good in my opinion.</p>
          <p>I might show some pictures of my progress soon because I'm too lazy to take screenshots right now.</p>

          <h2>11/3/21 - Becoming less evil</h2>
          <p>Yesterday morning, I made a blog post where I claimed that this website saves cookies to all visitors without any consent. Well I'm happy to announce that as of last night, this is no longer the case. A cookie will only be created if you enable experimental mode in the settings. Disabling it will also delete the cookie. So yeah, I guess I'm less evil now.</p>
          <p>Today I've been working on a tool to help me create more blog posts, and I'm using it right now to write this one. It's basically just an html page with text boxes that I can write in. It then wraps everything in the correct html tags and copies the result to clipboard. When I'm done writing this post, all I have to do is paste the generated html into the blog page.</p>
          <p>It's been a fun tool to work on, but it still lacks some features I'd like. At the moment, I can click a button to add a new paragraph, but I can't delete a paragraph. I also can't add images. Working on this tool and the cookie system is helping get a better hold of JavaScript. Hopefully my skill can improve to the point that I can make something more interesting.</p>
          <p>Ok I hope this thing works right now because if it fails, I'm not re-writing this whole post.</p>
        </div>
		<div class="post">
		  <h2>11/2/21 - Almost been a month</h2>
		  <p>My last post was almost a month ago, so I guess I should explain why.</p>
		  <p>First, I've been focusing mostly on school stuff. I like to write the blog posts at the end of the day, and lately I've been busy later in the day. Second, I had exchanged the free time I had to work on the website for time to learn JavaScript. Third, I really wanted my next post to be about a specific cool thing I made, but I haven't been able to take good pictures of it.</p>
		  <p>The good news is that I worked a little bit on the website again. Using the JavaScript that I learned, I created a secret experimental mode for the website. If you enable it right now, it replaces the background to one that's a little more lively. There are still issues with it, so I don't want it on by default. My solution was to save a preference as a cookie. That's right, if you are reading this, your device has already been tainted by my cookie without your permission. Your welcome.</p>
		  <p>To access the secret settings, just press the 's' key on any of the pages. Experimental mode is the only setting you can change right now, but there will probably be more in the future. In fact, it might become a real settings page instead of being a secret one.</p>
		  <p>That's all for today. Move along and enjoy your cookie.</p>

		  <h2>10/5/21 - What happened to the jam project</h2>
		  <p>I've been avoiding this topic because the state of the project was always changing.</p>
		  <p>I basically knew I wouldn't finish after I was a week in, but I still kept lightly working on it. School was keeping me busy so that took up the majority of my time. I gave up for real like a week ago and I made a poster based on what I came up with. This is a way for me to put the work I did out there while still leaving the concept open for an other attempt later on. I'm just glad I had the chance to make cool stuff this summer.</p>
		  <p>Wow, I kind of thought I would have a lot more to say. Maybe I'm forgetting something.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="post">
		  <h2>10/1/21 - September ended</h2>
		  <p>And its time to wake up</p>
		  <p>Anyways, today is the first day that my campus is officially reopened, and I am currently typing this in the library. I've already been going to campus twice a week for a drawing class because it was exempt from the schools online policy. Now I have to go for two other classes as well.</p>
		  <p>Honestly I'm kind of hyped for this month. Its looking like I'm getting back on track with my work which should give me enough free time to watch Over the Garden Wall again. I also just like the fall weather. I get to wear sweaters again.</p>
		  <p>Okay my teacher is talking about actual important stuff now so bye.</p>

		  <h2>9/30/21 - Clickbaiting my stuff</h2>
		  <p>I haven't paid any attention to my Youtube channel since I went all in with Newgrounds, but I looked at it recently and I realize how poorly managed it is. I don't really care for success on Youtube, but it would be nice if the videos at least looked interesting. I know for a fact that I would never click on most of the videos because of the clunky titles.</p>
		  <p>For example, I would never click on "Club Penguin Schmooves and Schemes (Twitch Highlights EP.5)" but I would click on "I joined a gang in Club Penguin"</p>
		  <p>I know I wont do it for every video but the majority will be renamed. Not right now though because I don't feel like it.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="post">
		  <h2>9/26/21 - Bike is fixed</h2>
		  <p>My bike has actually been fixed for a while now, but I never got around to writing an update to that story. I'm only bringing this up because I mentioned my bike being broken before, so I guess I'm trying to provide a sort of resolution.</p>
		  <p>I'd say it was worth the cost to fix it because Its still a good bike for the most part. It even feels a bit better now. It still has issues with changing gears, but that's an unrelated problem that's sort of always been there. Its finicky but it works if I tweak it every once in a while. I don't really need the highest gear anyway. I'm excited to take it out again for adventures. And by adventures I mean ride it to the park and vibe out on a bench.</p>
		  <p>By the way this reminds me of a weird argument I make sometimes about the bicycle being the best symbol of freedom, so stay tuned for whenever I decide to explain that on here.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="post">
		  <h2>9/25/21 - Nothing is enjoyable</h2>
		  <p>I'm no stranger to this feeling, but it still catches me off guard every time. Thankfully, this iteration of my dread is rooted in logic, which is much easier to deal with than the kind that manifests itself for no reason.</p>
		  <p>My issue is that I care about too many things, so focusing on any one objective makes me feel guilty for neglecting the others. My physical health, school work, and personal creative projects are all conflicting with each other causing my life efficiency to plummet. But I don't really need to be healthy, right? I'm probably gonna drop that, at least for now. If everything goes according to plan, I should be in a more stable situation after about two weeks. Just got to hold off until then.</p>
		  <p>Sorry for being super dramatic and stuff. This is just what happens when I try to make a post everyday.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="post">
		  <h2>9/24/21 - 100 people</h2>
		  <p>I haven't acknowledged this on the blog yet, so I figured that I should. I hit 100 followers on Newgrounds like a week or two ago. I know that still isn't a lot, but the number 100 is too appealing for my weak mind to ignore. It's been really nice to feel welcome in that community. Seeing my pico model on the front page banner was cool. At this point, I don't mind if my work never receives attention again because I already feel fulfilled on that front. I haven't been super active on Newgrounds recently, but I'll get back to it whenever I'm not busy.</p>
		  <p>Now about my laptop, it seems actually functional. I still haven't tested the hdmi port, but everything else works. I've even managed to add the "back to top" button completely from this laptop.</p>
		  <p>This post is now the the second of two consecutive blog updates. Let's see if I can start a new streak.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="post">
		  <h2>9/23/21 - Laptop 2</h2>
		  <p>Remember how one of the few things I've talked about here has been my difficulties with acquiring a laptop. Well, more specifically I was having issues with returning one. Fortunately, this story is over I think?</p>
		  <p>Today my new laptop came in. Bought it with the money I got from the other that was returned. It's not as good but its also cheaper. I'm typing on it right now and its pretty cool. The other one had almost no functioning ports, and so far, I can confirm that all of the usb ports work on this new one. Hopefully everything works properly, but I won't really know until tomorrow when I test it a bit more. Like I've said before, I'm excited for what this means in terms of my productivity. </p>
		  <p>Quickly going to mention some other stuff now.</p>
		  <p>My animation jam entry is probably canceled. I'll talk more about that later.</p>
		  <p>I lost my blogging streak. Big surprise.</p>
		  <p>My arms hurt very a lot. I've been working out again and I'm no where near as strong as I used to be. Kinda sad.</p>
		  <p>I streamed today and that was fun. I was just doing math homework but it was kind of a throwback to my earliest streams. Hopefully able to do more soon.</p>
		  <p>That's it for today. Gotta get back to laying down. The ceiling isn't gonna watch itself.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="post">
		  <h2>9/18/21 - Professor better curve my grade</h2>
		  <p>because otherwise I'm not doing so well in math. Its funny too because this is the easiest math class I've had in years.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="post">
		  <h2>9/17/21 - Issues with website</h2>
		  <p>I've realized that at some point, it would be inefficient of me to keep the whole blog on one page. I have to come up with some improved system, whether it be multiple pages, individual pages for each post, or loading functionality. I don't know when I will have the time to restructure this, but I think I can at least make a "back to top" button that will make things nicer for now.</p>
		  <p>Also since I'm already talking about the website, the search rankings have tanked really bad. Its been bad for a while so I don't think it will ever go back up. I just wish I understood why it moved down so much. I know that its ultimately an unimportant issue, but it bugs me. At least I have conquered the rankings of every other commonly used search engine.</p>
		  <p>I love how one of the most common topics on here is the website itself. This is some enticing reading.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="post">
		  <h2>9/16/21 - I'm tired and I don't want to post</h2>
		  <p>I really want to sleep right now and also its 11:11 while I'm typing this so that's cool. :( Its 11:12 now. But back to my point, I'm just making this post because I don't want to lose my streak. I didn't write anything for Monday but otherwise I've been doing this mostly daily. k bye</p>
		</div>
		<div class="post">
		  <h2>9/15/21 - History is Fluid</h2>
		  <p>The majority of my blog posts have been altered in secret. Barely any of them remain in their original form. I can rewrite history and no one can tell the difference between reality and fiction.</p>
		  <p>But don't worry, the only changes I've made are typo fixes. You see, I've been typing all of the posts into a text editor without spell check, so I've had to fix a bunch of typos. Only recently did I find out that I can enable spell check in this editor, so I hopefully won't be doing this as often any more.</p>
		  <p>While I have only used this power to fix typos, I like the thought that I can cause paranoia about the contents of this page. Maybe I will just straight up make a post for a day that never originally had one. Nothing is stopping me. I control history.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="post">
		  <h2>9/14/21 - i got scammed by a kid on roblox</h2>
		  <p>I would call this a new low point but that would be a disservice to my life. Also it really wasn't that bad.</p>
		  <p>Basically, I was looking for a new Roblox game to play during class, and I started playing one where you try to survive in a crime infested city. You can work as a floor scrubber to make some money, but the stores in the city only sell stuff like clothes and food instead of weapons. To get weapons, you have to negotiate with other players. I was offered a knife in exchange for 50 in-game Euro. I gave the guy the money and he left. No knife. I got played on roblox.</p>
		  <p>I forgot everything else I was going to talk about. My shameful story is all that I can think of right now.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="post">
		  <h2>9/12/21 - Anime Musicals</h2>
		  <p>Over the past few days, I've been making my way through the Death Note musical. I had no idea that this existed and its really weird. I kinda like it though.</p>
		  <p>I haven't heard of any other musical adaptations of anime, but I suspect there isn't many. After thinking about it, I've come to the conclusion that Death Note might be the absolute best candidate for a musical adaptation, at least out of anime that I'm aware of. Its short, characters are built around conflicting ideologies, the main character's tragic fate is established at the beginning, and it features gods lamenting over humanity. It was litterally ripe for this kind of thing.</p>
		  <p>Overall I really enjoyed the first half, but things start to fall apart later in the show. I think the ending just feels a bit too rushed. The music is pretty good though. I might look for more anime musicals, assuming that they're a common thing.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="post">
		  <h2>9/11/21 - Additional Historical Event</h2>
		  <p>While I would normally wouldn't have much to say about this, today marks 20 years since the attack on the World Trade Center, so I figured I might say a few words.</p>
		  <p>I wasn't even born at the time, so I have no memory of the immediate fear and tragedy it caused. All I remember is that the war on terror has been going on throughout my whole life. The recent Afghanistan retreat felt so unreal to me because the U.S. has been there for literally as far back as I can remember. It sucks to know that despite that, the conflict is far from over. I pay my respects to every innocent person killed in the wake of war.</p>
		  <p>Sorry for the serious post. I'll get back to my typical stupid shenanigans tomorrow.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="post">
		  <h2>9/10/21 - Judgement Day</h2>
		  <p>You're either stupid, or not.</p>
		  <p>In case that anyone reading this is unaware, today marks a significant moment in internet culture. In American notation, the date reads 9/10/21, a sequence of numbers that should seem familiar to anyone with an okay knowledge of memes. The 9+10=21 vine is being celebrated today for this reason.</p>
		  <p>It's interesting to see how events like this arise out of the dumbest of jokes. It's arguable whether the original vine is even funny, but its impact can't be ignored. I'm not sure if there will ever be another date that lines up with a meme as well as this.</p>
		  <p>I actually vaguely remember being at school and talking about how the date was 12/12/12. That was honestly cooler than this. Also ultimate pi day on 3/14/15. My teacher brought us pie that day. But yeah, human like when number have meaning.</p>
		  <p>I don't want to talk about anything else right now. I just wanted to acknowledge this moment because it will never happen again. Except for next month where the European date will be 9/10/21.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="post">
		  <h2>9/9/21 - bad vibes</h2>
		  <p>Haven't really gotten much work done on the animation. The main model is a bit further along and I have some stuff written, but I've mostly been focusing on school. The bad vibes come from the fact that I'm procrastinating on school. Even as I just wrote that last sentence, I heard thunder. Today is just giving off bad vibes man.</p>
		  <p>Oh I almost forgot, more bad vibes. My trusty bicycle that took me through high school is wounded. The crank arm has been loose for a while but it's now unusable. I took a look at it today and it turns out that the whole shaft was messed up. Buying the whole thing new is probably going to be like 40 bucks. I'm probably going to fix it instead of buying another used bike. It means a lot to me at this point so I feel like it deserves to have some money thrown at it.</p>
		  <p>It's not all bad though. This is all just unimportant in the long run. Whenever I run into a lot of little problems at once, it feels like too much, but I know that I'm complaining about nothing. I just need some time to take things in and set up action plans for everything. Being overwhelmed is what brings out my full potential. Working out usually helps with my stress, so I guess that's what I'm going to do next morning.</p>
		  <p>In fact, I'm just going to turn my health around again. It's been too long since I've done any running or training. It's time for me to regain my strength. Let it be known that I am beginning a new redemption arc. I'm gonna kill the bad vibes, no matter the cost.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="post">
		  <h2>9/6/21 - Really nice day</h2>
		  <p>I didn't have class today because of Labor Day, so I finally sort of got a break from catching up on school work. I enjoyed my freedom for a good chunk of the day, but the rest of my time was spent working on my newest project.</p>

		  </figure>
		  <p>The model is still going to be worked on plenty, but this is a decent start. I hope that I can keep up the pace because rendering the video might take up more time than I would like it too. There's going to be a lot of stuff like glass, which will probably force me to render at higher samples.</p>
		  <p>I feel like I'm going to have a fun time working on this, even if I don't end up making the deadline.</p>

		  <h2>9/5/21 - Work starting on new project</h2>
          <p>I'm still poop busy with school stuff, but plans for my next animation are in motion. I'm going to be making a fake trailer for a short film I wanted to make a while back.</p>
          <figure>

		  </figure>
		  <p>I hope I can do this idea justice. It was originally cancelled because I couldn't come up with a satisfying conclusion to the story, but that wont be necessary for this fake trailer. The idea never went further than my sketches.</p>
		  <p>Other random thing of note, the current Newgrounds banner has my Pico model on it. It features several models from the newgrounds 3d discord. Pretty cool.</p>

		  <h2>9/2/21 - Too cool for school</h2>
		  <p>Okay I'm actually not too cool for school but I needed a title. This post is just going to be a general update. We'll start with the most relevant stuff and go from there.</p>
		  <p>I have now surpassed 100 followers on Newgrounds! In celebration of this, I will be smiling today at 1:30 p.m. pst.</p>
		  <p>Also Newgrounds related, there is only one round left in the Summer Animation Jams. I think it starts tomorrow so hopefully I can get all of my homework done today.</p>
		  <p>Happy one month anniversary to the website, although I'm almost a week late on saying that. I haven't been posting as much because life has been a bit busy, and I think its reasonable to assume that this will continue. I'm trying to learn a bit of python to write a simple program that should make blog posts easier to make. It will mostly just serve as an excuse for me to learn python, kind of like how _______________ was an excuse for me to learn html + css.</p>
		  <p>And thats it for today. Gonna do some homework now.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="post">
		  <h2>8/22/21 - Completed stuff</h2>
		  <p>I've returned from time warping. I completed my collab entry a day earlier than planned, so that's nice to have out of the way. It was cool to work on that project overall, but it was unfortunately caught in the middle of me being fairly busy. After that I knocked out my animation jam round 4 entry with more time left over than expected. Not by much though. I'm basically just free for this afternoon because I start school tomorrow. Still nice to feel free for moment though.</p>
		  <p>Alright other updates. My battle with search rankings seems to be over. This website finally shows up on page one if you look up flare145. The only results that show up above it are my other accounts, which is perfect. I have no idea why it was tanking so hard after I initially started to improve the website. It legit went down to the 6th page of results at one point. Really weird.</p>
		  <p>Might stream soon if school doesn't get in the way. I've wanted to get back to it so hopefully that happens.</p>

		  <h2>8/18/21 - Time Warping</h2>
		  <p>I have two projects to complete in a very short amount of time. The biggest time constraint is my arch nemesis: school. I start my first semester of uni in 5 days. This means that I can only reasonably allocate 2 days per project. This calls for some time warping.</p>
		  <p>Now you might be thinking, what is time warping? Is it even real? The answer is yes, and its called not sleeping. I can easily add 4 additional hours to every day I work by starting 2 hours earlier and stoping 2 hours later. Over 4 days, this becomes 16 additional hours. This is the kind of stuff high school actually teaches you.</p>

		  <h2>8/16/21 - Cool relic</h2>
		  <p>Today I was cleaning my room and I found a comic I drew more than 2 years ago. This was for my first actual art class, which was a fun experience considering that I never thought my drawings would leave the margins of my notes.</p>
		  <figure>
		    <img src="/blogimages/081621comic.png" alt="A man places an apple on top of his friends head, preparing to shoot an arrow at the apple. After a loud splat, we see the archer seated at a dining table with someone else. 'Hey where's your friend?' 'Well umm...' He arrives and anounces, I made some apple pie.'" style="width:60vmin; display:inline; max-width:790px;">
			<figcaption>Photo of the comic, drawn on an 18x12" paper sheet.</figcaption>
		  </figure>
		  <p>Part of what makes this interesting is that I drew it before starting my now cancelled webcomic. The webcomic was heavily story based, but it was going to have occasional light hearted spin off issues resembling this comic. Its also cool in that I had rarely drawn anything at this scale. Before this, I litterally only doodled on notes and index cards. I'll definitely post some of those eventually.</p>
		  <p>Now for actual news, work on my newest animation is going according to plan. It's nothing super special, but its nice to be working on collabs. Lot of cool folk out there.</p>

		  <h2>8/12/21 - The long post</h2>
		  <p>This is the post I've been afraid of. The large one. The big boy. The chungus I dare say. I've been trying to keep these nice and short, but I won't today. Mostly because I have to copy and paste in that comment I mentioned before, but also because I guess I got some FLARE145 related updates. Don't question the all caps, I just do that.</p>
		  <p>First up on the list, my weird common core YouTube comment. I mentioned this in the last blog post, and I'm going to try to give more context. I won't post a link to the video because I don't want to deal with it breaking or anything. The video was fairly new, and I think you could find it with the right amount of internet sleuthing. Anyways, I had no problems with what was said in the video. It was a really nice recap of the story of how U.S. education changed in response to students scoring lower than those in other nations. I'm not sure why I decided to comment. I guess I just find the topic interesting. It got a whopping eight likes so people must really like hearing my thoughts. Man sometimes I type stuff and realize why tone indicators exist. Here is the comment in full:</p>
		  <p>"I believe I was in fourth grade when I first started encountering common core. At the time, I didn't understand the controversy behind it. I was being told that my education was going to become more difficult for no good reason, and I believed it. I hated going to school because I was told that it had gotten worse. I'm now a high school graduate, and I have a better understanding of what actually happened. In retrospect, I think that I genuinely benefited a lot from common core. My parents never had the opportunity to go through proper education, so they were never going to be able to help me with my homework anyways. My siblings and I were already used to this, so the new curriculum didn't make that into a problem for me. Most of the stuff that people pointed out as nonsense useless explanations were really there to teach effective ways of thinking. I feel like I learned how to learn in a way that is much different than brute force memorization. It was also really interesting to see the push towards classroom collaboration. Especially in math, we worked in groups so often that it helped us to understand how to work with others and build off of each others ideas. The world could use a lot more of this collaborative attitude. I think its funny when people complain about how the American school system is an outdated relic from the industrial revolution, and then simultaneously complain about how common core is too different from the old ways of teaching. Common core was literally the evolution of teaching that people were asking for. Its a shame that it became such a controversial political issue. It tainted my experience at the time, and I wish I could have gone through school without anyone telling me that the government was working against me. Still, I'm glad that I actually learned at school instead of learning to memorize."</p>
		  <p>Man I just pasted that in and I do not want to read that. Well, onto whatever is next.</p>
		  <p>Thank you me. Next up is the story of my battle with google search. I want this site to appear when you search flare145 into google, but it never shows up on the first page of search results. I ended up registering my website in google's web optimization tools and it seemed like one of the problems was my lack of mobile compatibility. I had already tested mobile support and it worked fine, but I guess I didn't do it the proper way. I've since made more changes that fixed this, which actually lowered my google search ranking. I think this is because I removed a footer that said something like "flare 145 flare145 FLARE145." This was to increase searchability, and I think it worked? I had to get rid of it because the google optimization stuff said that the page had unreadable text, which was true. I made the footer impossible to actually see so that it just acted as tags. I have meta tags set up too, but they don't seem to work as well. I think removing the footer is what made my ranking go down, so now I'm going to correct it by saying FLARE145 once in a while. I've now done it five times in this post, so I think I'm doing pretty well.</p>
		  <p>I also want to mention again that more stuff is supposed to be on the website. It just won't be for a while. My hope is that the blog page becomes the most boring part of the site, but until then, little style changes will probably keep occurring. This page especially looks a bit different, and no I will not describe it to future proof this post. You just had to be there to see it.</p>
		  <p>And now back to vanity. Or maybe not vanity but... I don't actually know. More me centered stuff I guess. Maybe I would call this the boring part but I'm not sure the rest of the post was interesting enough for me to make that distinction. Anyways, I'm talking about the laptop again. This has obviously been a fan favorite topic that even captures the attention of the dead. I hopefully will be bringing it up less often now because I finally dropped it off to get shipped yesterday. That is all.</p>
		  <p>Well, this has been a long post. I'm actually typing this into google docs instead of directly into the html file like I usually do. Wow I've probably mentioned google more than FLARE145	 now. Haha managed to sneak in two more flare145s. Anyways, I think posts should remain short for three reasons. First, this giant block of text looks too daunting to read, and while I don't care if people read it or not, it bugs me that even I would never want to read this. Second, this is going to look really weird in the html for me. And third, idk i forgor :|</p>

		  <h2>8/10/21 - Chill day</h2>
		  <p>Today was a nice day. I was waiting for an other email related to laptop thing so I just drew for a while and watched some YouTube. Hopefully I can get the laptop sent out tomorrow or the day after.</p>
		  <p>I made a somewhat heated comment on YouTube today. Or at least it felt heated in the moment. I was watching a video about the common core curriculum and I have some opinions on how it affected American education. I think I'll copy and paste it into a blog post soon because it might be interesting.</p>
		  <p>If everything goes according to plan, I should be spending most of tomorrow working on my collab animation I've been neglecting. I'm hoping I can knock it out this week but my gut is saying that it will take longer.</p>
		</div>
		<div class= "post">
		  <h2>8/9/21 - Don't want to school</h2>
		  <p>Looks like I'm going to be able to return the laptop. Different departments of the manufacturing company said conflicting things about my warranty, and it took way too long for everything to get sorted out. What an awful experience.</p>
		  <p>In other news, I'm currently dreading going to university. I didn't get as much financial aid as I had hoped, so I feel guilty for going because it seems like a waste of money. Mostly because I chose to be an art major, and that seems to be like one of the worst degrees you can get. Or at least they don't have quite the same value as some other degrees. I wish I could just take a year off and work on my own stuff to build up a nice portfolio. Maybe I'll just drop out or something. Unless I get better financial aid next year. It would be better for me to stay if that were the case.</p>
		  <p>It's weird how much teachers believed in my potential for success. I wish I could tell them all that I have no idea what I'm doing with my life and that I've always been no different from anyone else. Or maybe they already knew that. </o>

		  <h2>8/6/21 - Things falling apart</h2>
		  <p>The laptop is defective. The headphone jack doesn't work and the usb ports aren't capable of transferring data. I spent a large chunk of my day dealing with customer support hell. I know it's a hardware issue because I've tried every conceivable driver fix. I'm disappointed.</p>
		  <p>This is the last in a string of events that have wasted too much of my time, and I've made the call to cancel my next animation to prevent me from overworking myself. I'm not looking forward to making a more public post about this, but I'm sure everyone will understand.</p>

		  <h2>8/5/21 - Laptop</h2>
		  <p>I bought a laptop for school this fall, and it arrived today. While computer upgrades came from my money, this is technically bought from my parents money because they are going help with school expenses. The excitement of setting up a new device has eaten away at more of my time, but its worth it because it should make me more productive in the long run. Mostly because I can work on things in more places, but it will also serve as a good machine to remotely control my computer. I've also cloned my repositories so I can make posts to this website from the laptop, which is what I'm doing right now. Really convenient I think.</p>
		  <p>This morning I was playing minesweeper and I won two games with the same time.</p>

		  <h2>8/4/21 - Time wasting</h2>
		  <p>I've gotten incredibly good at wasting time. I'm supposed to be animating for the animation jam, but I guess I have very low expectations of this one because I can't seem to stay focused for more than 30 minutes at a time. I almost fell asleep 3 times today so thats cool for time. I was actually listening to a podcast today where the hosts were discussing different forms of time wasting and it felt super relevant to my life. Fun coincidence. At least I'm still getting work done, even if its slow.</p>

		  <h2>8/3/21 - All the Newgrounds love</h2>
		  <p>Man I'm really happy my stuff is doing well on Newgrounds. My newest animation got first place in the second round. Summer Animation Jams. I got seventh on the previous round, so I'm currently second place in total. I don't think I'll score well on the next one, but depending on the themes of the future rounds, I have a shot at keeping top ten.</p>
		  <p>Also my previous animation got frontpaged seemingly out of nowhere. That means that so far, I've gotton two art posts featured and two videos featured. I guess Newgrounds staff think I fit in. I mostly have BrandyBuizel to thank for my bit of success. He's championed my work quite a bit and I will never forget that.</p>
		  <p>I've now got a total of 59 fans on Newgrounds, making it my largest following on the internet. I hope that they enjoy my more orginal stuff when it comes out.</p>

		  <h2>8/1/21 - Website plans</h2>
		  <p>Right now, there are only 3 pages, being the landing, links, and blog pages. I plan on having a projects page that showcases work thats gone into my previous projects. Or something like that. It would become a lot more interesting once I get to work on personal projects that I've been wanting to work on for a while now. Not sure when that will happen because school and life, but one day I'll get around to it. I also might make a gallery page, which will act as a previous work portfolio sort of thing.</p>
		</div>
		<div class= "post">
		  <h2>7/31/21 - First "post"</h2>
		  <p>So this page is going to become my official blog. This website is still very much a work in progress, but its been a fun little thing to work on. This is the grand sequel to my old google sites page which I made back when I was like 11.</p>

			<figcaption>A screenshot of my old website, which I had named "the flarin website"</figcaption>
		  </figure>
		  <p>I'm not sure what I'll do exactly with this page. It's mostly here as an homage to the news page on the original website, but It might be fun to post wip stuff from my projects. Not many people will actually see this, so I can probably talk about spoiler-ish stuff related to whatever I'm currently working on. So yeah. Come back once a year or something to see what I've been up too. It might be more interesting than the kind of stuff I put on twitter.</p>
