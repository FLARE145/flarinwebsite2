		  <h2>8/9/21 - Don't want to school</h2>
		  <p>Looks like I'm going to be able to return the laptop. Different departments of the manufacturing company said conflicting things about my warranty, and it took way too long for everything to get sorted out. What an awful experience.</p>
		  <p>In other news, I'm currently dreading going to university. I didn't get as much financial aid as I had hoped, so I feel guilty for going because it seems like a waste of money. Mostly because I chose to be an art major, and that seems to be like one of the worst degrees you can get. Or at least they don't have quite the same value as some other degrees. I wish I could just take a year off and work on my own stuff to build up a nice portfolio. Maybe I'll just drop out or something. Unless I get better financial aid next year. It would be better for me to stay if that were the case.</p>
		  <p>It's weird how much teachers believed in my potential for success. I wish I could tell them all that I have no idea what I'm doing with my life and that I've always been no different from anyone else. Or maybe they already knew that. </o>

		  <h2>8/6/21 - Things falling apart</h2>
		  <p>The laptop is defective. The headphone jack doesn't work and the usb ports aren't capable of transfering data. I spent a large chunk of my day dealing with customer support hell. I know it's a hardware issue because I've tried every conceivable driver fix. I'm disappointed.</p>
		  <p>This is the last in a string of events that have wasted too much of my time, and I've made the call to cancel my next animation to prevent me from overworking myself. I'm not looking forward to making a more public post about this, but I'm sure everyone will understand.</p>

		  <h2>8/5/21 - Laptop</h2>
		  <p>I bought a laptop for school this fall, and it arrived today. While computer upgrades came from my money, this is technically bought from my parents money because they are going help with school expenses. The excitement of setting up a new device has eaten away at more of my time, but its worth it because it should make me more productive in the long run. Mostly because I can work on things in more places, but it will also serve as a good machine to remotely control my computer. I've also cloned my repositories so I can make posts to this website from the laptop, which is what I'm doing right now. Really convenient I think.</p>
		  <p>This morning I was playing minesweeper and I won two games with the same time.</p>

		  <p>I think this might be the fastest I've beaten it too, which is sad when you think about how much I've play minesweeper.</p>

		  <h2>8/4/21 - Time wasting</h2>
		  <p>I've gotten incredibly good at wasting time. I'm supposed to be animating for the animation jam, but I guess I have very low expectations of this one because I can't seem to stay focused for more than 30 minutes at a time. I almost fell asleep 3 times today so thats cool for time. I was actually listening to a podcast today where the hosts were discussing different forms of time wasting and it felt super relevent to my life. Fun coincidence. At least I'm still getting work done, even if its slow.</p>

		  <h2>8/3/21 - All the Newgrounds love</h2>
		  <p>Man I'm really happy my stuff is doing well on Newgrounds. My newest animation got first place in the second round. Summer Animation Jams. I got seventh on the previous round, so I'm currently second place in total. I don't think I'll score well on the next one, but depending on the themes of the future rounds, I have a shot at keeping top ten.</p>
		  <p>Also my previous animation got frontpaged seemingly out of nowhere. That means that so far, I've gotton two art posts featured and two videos featured. I guess Newgrounds staff think I fit in. I mostly have BrandyBuizel to thank for my bit of success. He's championed my work quite a bit and I will never forget that.</p>
		  <p>I've now got a total of 59 fans on Newgrounds, making it my largest following on the internet. I hope that they enjoy my more orginal stuff when it comes out.</p>

		  <h2>8/1/21 - Website plans</h2>
		  <p>Right now, there are only 3 pages, being the landing, links, and blog pages. I plan on having a projects page that showcases work thats gone into my previous projects. Or something like that. It would become a lot more interesting once I get to work on personal projects that I've been wanting to work on for a while now. Not sure when that will happen because school and life, but one day I'll get around to it. I also might make a gallery page, which will act as a previous work portfolio sort of thing.</p>

		  <h2>7/31/21 - First "post"</h2>
		  <p>So this page is going to become my official blog. This website is still very much a work in progress, but its been a fun little thing to work on. This is the grand sequel to my old google sites page which I made back when I was like 11.</p>

		  <p>I'm not sure what I'll do exactly with this page. It's mostly here as an homage to the news page on the original website, but It might be fun to post wip stuff from my projects. Not many people will actually see this, so I can probably talk about spoiler-ish stuff related to whatever I'm currently working on. So yeah. Come back once a year or something to see what I've been up too. It might be more interesting than the kind of stuff I put on twitter.</p>
