          <h2>Catching up more</h2>
		  <p class="date">1/17/22</p>
          <p>Wow another blog post already? Crazy I know. Just gonna mention stuff that didn't make the cut last time.</p>
          <p>First thing to address: What happened to that new artwork I was working on? So I haven't worked on it since I last showed it on here but its super close to being done. I just haven't worked on it because I'm working on bigger things instead.</p>
          <p>Speaking of bigger stuff, what's the progress on Railcar Wrestle? So oof yeah this one is canceled. Well more like pushed back. I knew I probably shouldn't have mentioned it when I did but hey, the blog is the place where I get to talk about early development stuff so that's bound to happen. This animation is still going to happen, but its now going to be part of a different even bigger project. I'm doing a smaller animation test instead. This smaller animation will 3d blank boi. I'm going to be testing the rig that is essentially the foundation for most of my future projects. Here's a sample model.</p>
          <figure>
            <img src="/blogimages/011722blankmodel.png" alt="A 3d model of a blank figure." style="width:45vmin; display:inline; max-width:790px;">
            <figcaption>Work in progress blank boi model wearing additional clothing.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>The clothing is a quick test of what further designed characters could look like. I will show more progress on this rig as it develops. Next blog post might feature the concept art for the specific character I need to make for the small animation test.</p>
          <p>Thinking about posting more progress on social media. I don't expect anyone to read this blog so it would be nice if it looked like I was actually working on something. But yeah I'll be back with more updates soon so until then, stay gamer gamers.</p>
