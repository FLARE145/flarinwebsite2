		  <h2>Don't want to school</h2>
		  <p class="date">8/9/21</p>
		  <p>Looks like I'm going to be able to return the laptop. Different departments of the manufacturing company said conflicting things about my warranty, and it took way too long for everything to get sorted out. What an awful experience.</p>
		  <p>In other news, I'm currently dreading going to university. I didn't get as much financial aid as I had hoped, so I feel guilty for going because it seems like a waste of money. Mostly because I chose to be an art major, and that seems to be like one of the worst degrees you can get. Or at least they don't have quite the same value as some other degrees. I wish I could just take a year off and work on my own stuff to build up a nice portfolio. Maybe I'll just drop out or something. Unless I get better financial aid next year. It would be better for me to stay if that were the case.</p>
		  <p>It's weird how much teachers believed in my potential for success. I wish I could tell them all that I have no idea what I'm doing with my life and that I've always been no different from anyone else. Or maybe they already knew that. </p>
