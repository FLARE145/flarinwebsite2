          <h2>Thanksgiving Inbound</h2>
		  <p class="date">11/20/21</p>
          <p>Ok I said that I would post some new drawings, but I'm literally too lazy to take nice pictures of them to host on here. Maybe I'll do that later.</p>
          <p>With that out of the way, what have I been up to? Not a lot really. Schoolwork got a bit heavier again so I stopped working on the website for about 2 weeks. However, it was during this time that I found my Dsi. I had been searching for it over the last few months and I was convinced I had lost it. I backed up all the data on it and proceeded to mod it. There is an art post on my newgrounds titled "Moving Day" which goes into more detail about the what I did with the modded device. </p>
          <p>I might make another blog post tomorrow going over a few more updates, but for now I want to the sleep so bye</p>
