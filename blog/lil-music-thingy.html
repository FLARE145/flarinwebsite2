          <h2>Lil music thingy</h2>
		  <p class="date">2/15/22</p>
          <p>Back in November, I procrastinated on an assignment so hard that I accidently made a whole song instead. I don't like using the word song to describe it because it doesn't have lyrics, but I don't know what else to call it. It's a three minute track that I put together using LLMS. Unfortunately, I have no idea what to do with it now.</p>
          <p>I had planned to put it up on Newgrounds during December, but I didn't manage to clean it up in time. It wasn't until recently that I even remembered that it existed. I gave it a fresh listen and honestly, I think it's pretty good. There's still some issues with it but I don't feel comfortable with just letting it go to waste. I think it deserves to go along with something. Like a music video or short game or something idk. That sounds like too much work though. Maybe I'll make a ton of them and release an album? That also sounds like a ton of work. I think that for now, I will just post it to this website somehow. Maybe it will be a secret link for the people who read this. Though I will definitely take it down once it has a purpose.</p>
          <p>In other news, I might be working on a new animated collab? I say might because I haven't committed to it yet. I'm not sure that I have the time to say yes to these things anymore. Could be fun though. If I ever agree to do it, I will mention it here.</p>
          <p>I've got one final update today regarding streaming. I've mentioned before that I'd like to stream weekly, but I still can't guarantee that I will. I would have started this week but I think I might have a lot of work to do tomorrow so I'm calling it off for now. If I do manage to get a weekly stream thing going, the plan is Wednesdays at 5:00 PM (PST). I'm guessing that I would only have the energy for short streams, so no six hour extravaganzas anytime soon. Only one to two hour streams. Hopefully I will be starting Half-Life 2 but if I don't feel like it, I will just stream some drawing.</p>
          <p>Thankfully I am done for the day so I get to relax for a few hours right now. Gonna lay down and watch an animal life documentary so bye.</p>
