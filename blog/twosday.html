          <h2>TWOSDAY</h2>
		  <p class="date">2/22/22</p>
          <p>Guys I was wrong about that other day, today is the real Twosday! The date is 2/22/22 and it lands on a Tuesday! You could also interpret this to mean that there are two Twosdays, and that makes total sense honestly. </p>
	      <p>I am currently typing this during genetics because I have no idea what is going on. Actually you know what, I should really pay attention to this class.</p>
          <p>Okay class is over now and I still have no idea what is going on. Anyways, today I got <i>two</i> things to talk about. Haha get it?</p>
          <p>First is that I have been up to nothing. I have not created anything of value lately. School is keeping me busy so progress on everything is so slow that it isn't worth mentioning.</p>
          <p>But I have some good news too. Streams are back and they are weekly. I started my playthrough of Half-Life 2 last week and it was fun. Streams are on Wednesdays at 5:00 so be there or be square. Hmmm... I just got an idea for the website. I might but a little advertisement for my weekly streams somewhere.</p>
          <p>Man, if only there were something like a Twosday miracle. I could really us a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now...</p>
