		  <h2>Nothing is enjoyable</h2>
		  <p class="date">9/25/21</p>
		  <p>I'm no stranger to this feeling, but it still catches me off guard every time. Thankfully, this iteration of my dread is rooted in logic, which is much easier to deal with than the kind that manifests itself for no reason.</p>
		  <p>My issue is that I care about too many things, so focusing on any one objective makes me feel guilty for neglecting the others. My physical health, school work, and personal creative projects are all conflicting with each other causing my life efficiency to plummet. But I don't really need to be healthy, right? I'm probably gonna drop that, at least for now. If everything goes according to plan, I should be in a more stable situation after about two weeks. Just got to hold off until then.</p>
		  <p>Sorry for being super dramatic and stuff. This is just what happens when I try to make a post everyday.</p>
