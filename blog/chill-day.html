		  <h2>Chill day</h2>
		  <p class="date">8/10/21</p>
		  <p>Today was a nice day. I was waiting for an other email related to laptop thing so I just drew for a while and watched some YouTube. Hopefully I can get the laptop sent out tomorrow or the day after.</p>
		  <p>I made a somewhat heated comment on YouTube today. Or at least it felt heated in the moment. I was watching a video about the common core curriculum and I have some opinions on how it affected American education. I think I'll copy and paste it into a blog post soon because it might be interesting.</p>
		  <p>If everything goes according to plan, I should be spending most of tomorrow working on my collab animation I've been neglecting. I'm hoping I can knock it out this week but my gut is saying that it will take longer.</p>
