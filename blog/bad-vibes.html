		  <h2>bad vibes</h2>
		  <p class="date">9/9/21</p>
		  <p>Haven't really gotten much work done on the animation. The main model is a bit further along and I have some stuff written, but I've mostly been focusing on school. The bad vibes come from the fact that I'm procrastinating on school. Even as I just wrote that last sentence, I heard thunder. Today is just giving off bad vibes man.</p>
		  <p>Oh I almost forgot, more bad vibes. My trusty bicycle that took me through high school is wounded. The crank arm has been loose for a while but it's now unusable. I took a look at it today and it turns out that the whole shaft was messed up. Buying the whole thing new is probably going to be like 40 bucks. I'm probably going to fix it instead of buying another used bike. It means a lot to me at this point so I feel like it deserves to have some money thrown at it.</p>
		  <p>It's not all bad though. This is all just unimportant in the long run. Whenever I run into a lot of little problems at once, it feels like too much, but I know that I'm complaining about nothing. I just need some time to take things in and set up action plans for everything. Being overwhelmed is what brings out my full potential. Working out usually helps with my stress, so I guess that's what I'm going to do next morning.</p>
		  <p>In fact, I'm just going to turn my health around again. It's been too long since I've done any running or training. It's time for me to regain my strength. Let it be known that I am beginning a new redemption arc. I'm gonna kill the bad vibes, no matter the cost.</p>
