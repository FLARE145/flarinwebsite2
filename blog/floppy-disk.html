          <h2>Floppy disk</h2>
		  <p class="date">3/15/22</p>
          <p>So I was at school and there was this pile of books in the hallway on my way to class. I walked up to it and there was a paper saying that the books were free. I found this thing on top of the pile and took it.</p>

            <figcaption>A 3.5 inch floppy disk</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>Pretty freaky looking. I actually don't have any way to read what's on it. It seems that nobody I know has a floppy disk reader so I might just get one online at some point. Not super worth it though because I would probably never use it again. It can't hold more than like 2mb of data so I doubt there's really much to see here anyway.</p>
          <p>I tried to come up with an Ides of March reference, but I've got nothing. Today has been a good day at least so that's kind of strange I suppose. Oh wait no my group project thing is due today so nevermind, this is an awful day. Curse you Caesar, you should have just turned around.</p>
