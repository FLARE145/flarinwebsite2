				<![CDATA[ <p class="date">11/10/23</p>
<p>Am postponing talking about everything else and am fully focused on this new website thing I mentioned yesterday. Long story short, I'm just kind of dumb. Long story long:</p>
<p>Our story begins in February of 2022. When I wasn't busy being a loser, I was trying to figure out how to be a famous loser. Why? I don't know. It's not really something I care about anymore, but that's beside the point. I was just learning about seo (search engine optimization) and wikidata (the true god of information on the internet (it's and even longer story)). My grand plan was to start a legit online magazine so that I could exist as the creator of said magazine, allowing myself the smallest bit of relevance needed to put myself into the google knowledge graph (i just feel insane at this point). The idea I came up with was called cool_urls. The idea was to make 6 issues a year with multiple articles on cool websites. This was obviously going to be a lot of work and cost me a significant amount of money, so I decided to hold off on it indefinitely, especially after considering that it wasn't a very inspired idea to begin with.</p>
<p>Still, I had some concept stuff put together and I ran into it again recently. I realized it might be fun to bring the idea back, but just as a single static webpage. Just a massive list of urls that someone could scroll through if they were bored. So, I had some time yesterday and put it together. It is live but I'm still not going to directly link it here. That is because I haven't settled on a domain name. Currently, and as always was the plan, the website is hosted at cool_urls.flare145.com. The issue is, that a domain should not include underscores. For some reason, I really like the underscore in the url. I can technically leave it as is, but I can never get an ssl certificate for it unless I get rid of the underscore. That means that the website is stuck on http instead of https. This is mostly a non issue, but it really bugs me. So I might go back and change it to cool-urls. It's not nearly as cool though. Idk. I looked more into it and technically if I buy a wildcard certificate, I could get away with it, but that is a very expensive solution. Like $40 dollars a year, which is way too expensive for something that is just a glorified bookmark list. It's annoying because you used to be able to use underscore in a subdomain with no problem. It feels like they just decided it was a problem in order to get more people to buy more wildcard certificates to get around it. You didn't hear it from me though.</p>
<p>So yeah. I guess the people at the top have bested me again. But who is really winning? The people who care about any of this, or the people who are willing to change one character of a subdomain to avoid paying $40 dollars a year for a website that doesn't matter at all. Who's to say</p>

			<title>Big things that I'm still processing</title>

				<![CDATA[ <p class="date">11/9/23</p>
<p>So two big things happened lately that I want to talk about for a bit.</p>
<p>First, the Five Nights at Freddy's movie finally came out. I watched it on release with my friends and it was really enjoyable. I was 11 when the first game came out so the franchise is sort of a core part of my childhood. It was surreal to see on the big screen. It is objectively not a good movie, but I loved it. Just felt like an important event in the universe. I could talk much more about the movie but all that really matters is that I think it is enjoyable. It made me unreasonably happy.</p>
<p>Second, the finale to Attack on Titan released. I've been following the anime for a long time now (though not from the start) so it is very significant to me emotionally. Attack on Titan is easily my favorite piece of media of all time and the finale cemented that. AOT is all I've been thinking about for the past few days and I feel like that wont stop anytime soon. It's honestly a hard show for me to recommend to most people, but if you have never seen it and have nothing to do, you should really watch it. My heart goes out to Etika and everyone else who never got to see the other side of the walls. Shinzou sasageyo</p>
<p>I'd like to talk about what I've been up to since the last post, but I think I'll save most of that for another day. Today, I actually just made another website for fun. I'm not gonna link it because the name might change, but it is out there right now. Pretty proud of it considering I made it in one day, although it is very simple. It would be <em>cool</em> if you managed to find it without a <em>url</em>. I'll talk about it soon so see you then.</p>

			<title>CoaXioN Website is shaping up</title>

			<description>
				<![CDATA[ <p class="date">10/3/23</p>
<p>I recently dedicated a good chunk of time to working on the <a href="https://coaxion.games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CoaXion Website</a>. It's still lacking info on the individual projects being worked on by the group, but the base for that stuff has been set. I'm not sure how much more time will be needed to finalize everything, but I will probably make another post about it when it happens because I'm actually really proud of that website. It's not a good website from an accessibility perspective, but in terms of vibe, I did pretty much exactly what I was asked to. I think the biggest sacrifices I made to the original vision are just stuff that would have made the mobile experience worse. I was really stubborn about mobile usability despite the heavy use of javascript. The final result is definitely something interesting, so maybe check it out by clicking that link way at the top of this paragraph.</p>
<p>Now I get to talk about other stuff hehe. Uhhh okay so Boxkid progress has slowed to a crawl. This is mostly because of the website stuff, but I'm back at it starting today. I've decided to keep drawing until I reach a satisfying ending for this first chapter, so it might still be a long time before I officially launch it. I've been feeling fairly nervous about it lately because I've realized that people are actually going to see this. Like, when I draw it, it's kind of just for me? It's like my really complicated way of venting. There's something frighteningly personal about it, so to expose that to the world is scary. Especially when the general presentation is something that looks half-completed on purpose. I'm worried that it will come across as something really lazy that has no heart, when really, it's something kind of lazy with potentially some heart. Idk. I'll just have to see how it goes.</p>
<p>Screw it I'm doing a long post today. Another thing about Boxkid is that I really want to show it to people I know who aren't aware of my online shenanigans. I think I've mentioned this a lot recently, but it's still something that makes me nervous. I think I want to introduce more people to my stuff soon, but it really is a painfully embarrassing situation. Sometimes I forget how weird it is that I do all of this random stuff that I care about, and then never tell people about it. I guess its because I don't think anything I make is that good, so it's embarrassing to say that I care about the stuff I make. It also feels grossly narcissistic to tell people to look at my internet stuff, but that's just because I'm already narcissistic in general, so I don't need more of that.</p>
<p>Okay weird rant over. Next blog post when I feel like. Thank you for reading this if you made it this far. You have earned nothing except for that strange and unnecessary thank you. Hope you're happy and goodbye</p>

			<title>Throw away thoughts on Boxkid</title>

				<![CDATA[ <p class="date">9/6/23</p>
<p>I've drawn 10 pages of my upcoming comic Boxkid Vs. the Ocean, although I'm not done editing them. I've been estimating Ch.1 to be about 30 pages in length, but I'm suddenly forced to make some release decisions right now.</p>
<p>I would feel comfortable releasing these 10 pages, but in terms of the story, nothing really happens in those first pages. I'd want the first chapter to feel like the first part of a pilot episode, but right now, it feels like the opening minute. Again, I'd be fine with this, but it would be months before anyone would be able to see a continuation, and therefore months before people really find out what the story is actually about.</p>
<p>Shorter chapters would let me update the comic more often, but the reader might not feel as satisfied. Especially at the beginning. So I'm not entirely sure what to do.</p>
<p>I said that BK was going to be my project that I care the least about, so I'm leaning towards the quicker releases. It will make less sense, but I think it's better to have something out there. Once things start to make more sense, more people will get interested. Hopefully the art style attracts readers on it's own.</p>
<p>The one thing is that I wonder if I should call the updates something other than chapters. I think chapter might imply something a lot longer, and in my head, I would know how many chapters constitute a "complete chapter." Maybe I'm not making any sense.</p>
<p>Okay so uh. Did I say anything of importance? Not sure. I guess if there's anything to take away from this, it's that BK might start soon. Or it might not. Thanks for reading! See you then hopefully</p>

				<![CDATA[ <p class="date">8/31/23</p>
<p>So lately, a lot of my free time has been going into gaming. Other than gaming though, I've been working on the CoaXion website. Still a lot to do but progress is chugging along. Something interesting happened today though.</p>
<p>I was trying to set up for potentially working on more DMCR achievement icons soon. I realized some of my files were still stuck on my old computer hard drive, so I had to go find and retrieve the files from there. While I was in there though, I figured I'd grab a few more files I hadn't had the time to transfer before. I ended up transferring the files for some old animation projects. Specifically Tankforce and Club Penguin Dance. Because I now had access to these again, I figured I'd make proper project pages for them. So that's what I did.</p>
<p>I didn't proof-read them at all, and I'm probably forgetting a lot of cool behind the scenes information, but the pages should be live now. I'll update them later on if I have to. I also finished another tiny animation for Dial-Up Studios today. I'll probably post about that again soon.</p>
<p>Yesterday there was a blue super moon, and I managed to take decent pictures of it. I put them together into like, one hdr picture. If I have time tomorrow, I might make it into a fun friday video. So yeah, really trippy how much I've done today. And seemingly out of nowhere too. </p>
<p>And finally to update on Boxkid: it's still goin. Slower this week because I worked on some extra stuff as mentioned above. I'm realizing that I might have to launch it next year if I don't speed up my process. Good thing I have no deadline or anything.</p>
<p>That's all for today. Gonna go game now probably bye</p>

			<title>Boxkid clay model</title>

			<description>
				<![CDATA[ <p class="date">8/3/23</p>
<p>I made a Boxkid clay model! I don't really know why. Well I know why. I was feeling bummed out and needed something to distract myself. I think I made this last week? Don't remember. Doesn't really matter. Is cool</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/blogimages/080323boxkid.jpg" alt="clay model of my character boxkid" style="width:45vmin; display:inline; max-width:790px;">

</figure>
<figure>
  <img src="/blogimages/080323boxkid3.jpg" alt="clay model of my character boxkid" style="width:45vmin; display:inline; max-width:790px;">
  <figcaption>One last pic for good measure</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I used some like, oil based clay? The one that doesn't dry. So I destroyed it because it wasn't actually cool enough to justify keeping it around. I'll prob make a digital model at some point to help me draw some panels down the line.</p>
<p>Speaking of, my progress on drawing the first chapter has slowed significantly. At least it doesn't matter too much since Boxkid isn't important. One of the reasons I've slowed down is that I've been putting more effort into making a website for CoaXioN. It's going smooth enough, but my brain feels filled to the brim with janky javascript code now. Portions of my brain are split between the different complex systems I've made for each of my websites. Blog posts are handled one way here, chapters of BK are handled a different way, and the blog posts for CoaXioN will also require a new system. It's hard not to get all of the different methods for stuff mixed up. Oh well. It's probably good for me to stress my brain a bit.</p>
<p>But yeah, I'm up to drawing page 6 of Boxkid. Am pretty happy with it but I know most people will not get it or will not care. But that's fine. Boxkid doesn't really get it or care either. In fact, I care so little that I'm not even going to finish thi</p>

				<![CDATA[ <p class="date">7/26/23</p>
<p>I haven't been working on Boxkid at full force, and I don't think I ever will. There's gonna be long wait times in between chapters. This is just so I don't waste all of my time doing one thing. I've also been working on other stuff like finishing the Coaxion logo (it looks awesome) and making a Coaxion website too. Well I haven't technically started on the website but I will. Oh I also streamed again too, so that was fun. I beat Half-Life 2 episode 1 in a single livestream. This means I just have to play episode 2 and then I'll be mostly caught up with Half-Life. Oh wow oh no this is a long and unstructured paragraph. Lets just end it bruh</p>
<p>Okay fresh paragraph for me to ruin. Let's get back to Boxkid. I spent a lot of time recently just establishing standards and formats for myself. Really small stuff like panel line width and trying to figure out how I want to letter the comic. I wanted to figure this stuff out first so that there can be some consistency in the comic. So yeah, kind of got the hang of that and now I think I have established a production pipeline for this project. I'm currently done drawing 4 pages of the comic, and 3 of those are completely ready. I'm hoping that I can end this first chapter in 30 pages, so according to that, I'm a tenth of the way done.</p>

<p>I'll update this soon with more Boxkid news. I want to see if I can produce at a faster rate now that I have my process down. See you next update!</p> ]]>

			<title>Back at studio A</title>

			<description>
				<![CDATA[ <p class="date">7/18/23</p>
<p>In my head, I like to think of my room as studio A. Just for fun. And wherever I physically am is studio B. Anyways ignore this thought, let's just get to the news.</p>
<p>So yeah, I'm back from Chicago. Was awesome and I can't wait to go again. Now that I'm back home, I have more tools available to me to finish that Coaxion logo. I think I'll probably stream that later today. If not soon.</p>
<p>Now onto some more interesting stuff. The blog now has an official rss feed! If you don't know what that is, I wouldn't be surprised. It's actually pretty annoying to explain to people so I won't try to right now. You can look it up if you are curious. If you know what rss means than this is cool, but if you don't, it's not something you should worry about. The link for the rss feed isn't public on the website yet, so I'll drop a link here so you can access it early if you'd like. You can follow <a href="http://flare145.com/blog-feed.xml" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my rss feed</a> on your preferred feed reader.</p>
<p>Along with this update, individual blog posts now have unique urls. You might remember that I <a href="http://flare145.com/blogpost?=what-no-creative-outlet-does-to-a-mf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">tried to do this before</a>, but my new method is better. I mainly did this so that the rss feed can link to it's corresponding blog post. Oh and if you're wondering why I'm suddenly going all in on this rss stuff, it's so that I can make an rss feed for Boxkid. So every time a new chapter releases, you would see the update if you follow the rss feed. I'm thinking of more ways to make sure people can easily hear of a new chapter release. Prob just do a twitter account or something. Maybe email list? I think that might cost me some money so no.</p>
<p>Uhhhhh yeah no more updates for today I think. I'll start drawing actual pages of boxkid soon so stay tuned for that.</p> ]]>

				<![CDATA[ <p class="date">7/4/23</p>
<p>I been in Chicago for the past week and I'm staying for like two more. I'm here because I'm visiting family and I've been having a great time.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/blogimages/070423chicago.png" alt="A view of the city of chicago" style="width:60vmin; display:inline; max-width:790px;">
  <figcaption>The windy city</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I have plenty of free time considering I'm on vacation and all, so of course I started to work on random projects. First, I've been working on a tattoo design for some friends. I don't really have a deadline for that so it tends to be something I work on only when I feel like it. Next, I've been messing with making a logo for <a href="https://www.moddb.com/company/conc-studios" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Coaxion</a>, which is currently still known as Concussion Studios. They are currently rebranding, so from this point forward I will only refer to them as Coaxion. Multiple people are working on the logo, so my designs might not ever make it. So here's a look at one of them for funsies.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/blogimages/070423coaxion.png" alt="Coaxion" style="width:60vmin; display:inline; max-width:790px;">
  <figcaption>A wip version of the logo</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Speaking of Coaxion, they just showed <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/deathmatch-classic-refragged" rel="noopener" target="_blank">DMCR</a> at <a href="https://www.dokomi.de/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dokomi</a>, which is a big anime expo in Germany. They had these cool demo machines for the game which where decorated with some the achievement icons I designed a while back. It's trippy to see something I worked on out in the world. I'm happy for the Coaxion people and <a href="https://pjx.carrd.co/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PJX</a>, who is the dev who represented at Dokomi.</p>

</figure>
<p>Okay last thing. If you follow me on twitter you know that I'm really into the idea of Boxkid. I talked about this last blogpost, but it's basically just a webcomic idea. While I don't feel comfortable actually starting the comic from where I am, I can still work on all of the surrounding aspects. Which is a lot actually. Mainly the website. I haven't bought a domain for it yet but it's currently live on <a href="http://boxkid.flare145.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">boxkid.flare145.com</a>. It's very much a work in progress, although the plan for the finished website probably won't look very impressive. I just need to be able to serve pages for people to read. But yeah check it out if you want to see my concept images.</p>
<p>And that's about it. Stay tuned for more info on Boxkid as that is the main thing I'm currently passionate about. Until next time</p> ]]>
