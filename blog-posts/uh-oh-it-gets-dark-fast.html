<p class="date">11/25/24</p>
<p>Earlier I made a post about how I build my routines around how I operate, and I tend to operate differently depending on the sun. Well, it's winter now and I'm struggling a tiny bit to adjust.</p>
<p>I've been noticeably less productive this past week, and I was kind of confused as to why. First, I have been working way more at my job. Probably twice the amount that I was in months prior. Still, even when I have time, I use it differently. Maybe it's because I'm tired from working more, but I don't think that's entirely it. I think it's because the sun is setting earlier. I need to adjust my habits to this change. Now that I'm aware of it, I'm hoping that it won't take long to fix.</p>
