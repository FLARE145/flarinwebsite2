<p class="date">6/24/24</p>
<p>For a while now, I've been trying to do a blog post every week. I think I might have started that in February? Idk. Point is, it's now been over a month since I've posted consistently. What happened?</p>
<p>I got busy. Work mostly. Also commissions which is nice. So considering I haven't made much progress on anything cool, I kind of just don't have much cool stuff to talk about right now. So, this is me officially calling off the weekly post thing. I'm going to post when I have stuff to talk about. Like how it was before. I actually really like the weekly thing, but for now it doesn't make much sense.</p>
<p>I kind of feel like making more off topic posts too. Like talking about what I think about instead of only what I'm working on. I think that would be fun for me.</p>
<p>Anyways, ignoring the two bike posts, last post I mentioned a new artwork. I think I was referring to the <a href="https://flare145.com/artwork/ti001" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ink wash</a> I made for my friend's birthday. It turned out really good so I'm proud of it. Also in that time, I finished <a href="https://flare145.com/artwork/di006" rel="noopener" target="_blank">another artwork</a> that I'd been working on for a long time. I think that happened in the same time frame at least. It's all jumbled in my head. Hopefully I can make some more of those soon, but likely my time will go into getting back to boxkid.</p>
<p>So yeah, stay tuned for more random stuff on here. I think next post might actually be a review of S1M issue 1. PS: just checked to I got that name right and found out applications are open for the second issue. Maybe I'll be there? See ya later</p>
