<p class="date">12/15/22</p>
<p>Idk what to call this post because it's going to be all over the place.</p>
<p>I've been very busy for the last couple of weeks. I'm still gonna be busy with work and Christmas gift stuff, but I definitely have free time again. I wish I could guarantee the Trinket Trouble behind the scenes but getting gifts for my family this year is more important to me. Hopefully I get around to it though. I'll just make it very short or something. Might be out after Christmas. The target is just December.</p>
<p>Also random cool thing, I'm working on a commission! Well, more like worked on. Also taking a break on that to finish stuff I just talked about. It's cool though. MTD commissioned me to make some paintings for DMCR maps so I plan to be working on those in January. I've already begun the first one as a physical painting, but I might stream the other ones if I do them entirely digitally. Not sure yet though. Also can't forget that Fun Friday is planned to start soon.</p>
<p>And to address the little that I have been up to, I've made a few tweaks to the website. Mostly just alignment stuff for mobile. I broke it when I added the projects page button, but it should be fixed now. </p>
<p>I've also spent a good amount of time watching various shows and movies. I might do a post soon with really brief reviews for all of them. Life had me kind of drained so I wasn't really in a creative mood for a bit. That's when I take a break from making stuff to intake stuff instead. It's been very pleasant lately.</p>
<p>Today I'm going to try photographing some of my physical paintings. My goal is to get the most accurate pictures of them as possible, but it's been hard to achieve that. I haven't tried with my mirrorless camera yet, so I hope this goes better than using my phone. These will go up on the art page once I get the new set up sorted out. This is the first step in that though.</p>
<p>Wow that was long. I guess that's what I get for not posting in a while. Uhh don't know how to say bye today. bye</p>
