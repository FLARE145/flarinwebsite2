<p class="date">9/15/21</p>
<p>The majority of my blog posts have been altered in secret. Barely any of them remain in their original form. I can rewrite history and no one can tell the difference between reality and fiction.</p>
<p>But don't worry, the only changes I've made are typo fixes. You see, I've been typing all of the posts into a text editor without spell check, so I've had to fix a bunch of typos. Only recently did I find out that I can enable spell check in this editor, so I hopefully won't be doing this as often any more.</p>
<p>While I have only used this power to fix typos, I like the thought that I can cause paranoia about the contents of this page. Maybe I will just straight up make a post for a day that never originally had one. Nothing is stopping me. I control history.</p>
