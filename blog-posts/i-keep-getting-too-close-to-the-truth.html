<p class="date">11/10/23</p>
<p>Am postponing talking about everything else and am fully focused on this new website thing I mentioned yesterday. Long story short, I'm just kind of dumb. Long story long:</p>
<p>Our story begins in February of 2022. When I wasn't busy being a loser, I was trying to figure out how to be a famous loser. Why? I don't know. It's not really something I care about anymore, but that's beside the point. I was just learning about seo (search engine optimization) and wikidata (the true god of information on the internet (it's and even longer story)). My grand plan was to start a legit online magazine so that I could exist as the creator of said magazine, allowing myself the smallest bit of relevance needed to put myself into the google knowledge graph (i just feel insane at this point). The idea I came up with was called cool_urls. The idea was to make 6 issues a year with multiple articles on cool websites. This was obviously going to be a lot of work and cost me a significant amount of money, so I decided to hold off on it indefinitely, especially after considering that it wasn't a very inspired idea to begin with.</p>
<p>Still, I had some concept stuff put together and I ran into it again recently. I realized it might be fun to bring the idea back, but just as a single static webpage. Just a massive list of urls that someone could scroll through if they were bored. So, I had some time yesterday and put it together. It is live but I'm still not going to directly link it here. That is because I haven't settled on a domain name. Currently, and as always was the plan, the website is hosted at cool_urls.flare145.com. The issue is, that a domain should not include underscores. For some reason, I really like the underscore in the url. I can technically leave it as is, but I can never get an ssl certificate for it unless I get rid of the underscore. That means that the website is stuck on http instead of https. This is mostly a non issue, but it really bugs me. So I might go back and change it to cool-urls. It's not nearly as cool though. Idk. I looked more into it and technically if I buy a wildcard certificate, I could get away with it, but that is a very expensive solution. Like $40 dollars a year, which is way too expensive for something that is just a glorified bookmark list. It's annoying because you used to be able to use underscore in a subdomain with no problem. It feels like they just decided it was a problem in order to get more people to buy more wildcard certificates to get around it. You didn't hear it from me though.</p>
<p>So yeah. I guess the people at the top have bested me again. But who is really winning? The people who care about any of this, or the people who are willing to change one character of a subdomain to avoid paying $40 dollars a year for a website that doesn't matter at all. Who's to say</p>
