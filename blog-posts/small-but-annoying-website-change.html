<p class="date">1/12/24</p>
<p>You might remember that I made a <a href="https://flare145.com/blogpost?=back-at-studio-a"rel="noopener"target="_blank">new system for individual blog post pages</a> a while back. Well recently I realized that there was still no way to access those except with a direct link. </p>
<p>I know how to get a link for a post because I know how it works, but it was also a little inconvenient to to that. So, I made the titles of each blog post link to their individual pages. This was a change I had to do by hand to each post. I updated my blog tool to accommodate for this as well. Hopefully I don't have to do a big manual thing like this anymore, but I know that is not the case. I think I'm going to learn AutoHotkey in preparation for the next stupid thing I do.</p>
<p>Not a very important post today but I just wanted to timestamp this event if you will. Now I can link this post the next time I want to give context for a new blog change.</p>
