<p class="date">5/22/25</p>
<p>For a long time now, I've been considering switching to Linux for my personal computer. I grew up with Windows, and I feel very comfortable in that environment, but I think it's time to move on.</p>
<p>I haven't switched to Windows 11 because I really like Windows 10. It's pretty much exactly the feeling I want from my computer. But, Microsoft is soon going to stop supporting Windows 10, and, I'm getting more tired with the annoying aspects of Windows. Just a few months ago, my computer refused to boot, and I had to do a sort of soft reset to fix it. It really bummed me out, and in looking up ways to fix it, I found that many people have had this experience. Sometimes, Windows just completely dies. It's weird. It's uncommon. But I don't want it to happen again.</p>
<p>I'm a huge fan of foss, but I do rely on software that is not open source. The Affinity creative suite is hugely useful to me, but these programs do not run on Linux. This is the only reason I will not make the complete jump to Linux, and I instead plan to run a dual boot setup. I will use Windows when I have to, and Linux the rest of the time. With my new job coming up, this makes more sense to do. I will have less time and energy to work on my own creative projects, so I'll probably end up using my computer more for leisure or simpler things. </p>
<p>It will still be a while before I do this because I want to buy another drive to make this all work nicely. In the meantime, I set up Linux on an old laptop I have. I actually did this <a href="https://flare145.com/blogpost?=on-linux" rel="nopener" target="_blank">once before</a> and made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g25G5yWGLc" rel="nopener" target="_blank">video about it</a>, but I'm using a different distro now. I'm now using OpenSUSE instead of Lubuntu. Surprisingly, this laptop is holding up well, so I'm glad I tried this out. I intend to someday use this on my main computer.</p>
<p>Fun fact: I'm writing this post on my Linux laptop! I don't think I did that last time so that's fun. Overall, messing with Linux on here is best described as fun. KDE Plasma is the desktop environment I'm using, and it has so many options for customization. I love it. I can't test gaming that well on here, but I know things have gotten better through Proton. I did download VVVVVV and it played fine, but I think that wasn't through a compatibility layer? I'm not sure. </p>

<p>I hope that I can make my "full" switch to Linux soon. The feeling I'm getting is similar to when I was first switching to Bluesky. In like October or November, I just stopped using Twitter, and everything genuinely felt better. I somewhat feel like I helped encourage my friends to use Bluesky more by setting an example. I want to do the same now with Linux. I just have to commit. And purchase another drive. And back up my files. And get dual boot working. It might be a while.</p>
