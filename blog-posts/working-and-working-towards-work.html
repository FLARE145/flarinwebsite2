<p>I doing things and making moves. We out here.</p>
<h3>Creative Projects</h3>
<p>So no real progress on Boxkid or Axo unfortunately. I'm glad that my current personal projects are limited to this at the moment. It's nice and I don't feel bad for taking time.</p>
<h3>Commission Work</h3>
<p>This week I got commissioned! I won't really explain what it is until I'm done and have clear permission to post it here, but I'm pretty happy with it so far. It's a very small thing but it's still cool to do these every once in a while. I'd like to build up my reputation to do more stuff like this.</p>
<p>At the moment, I feel I have to charge less than the value of my work, but I'm usually fine with this if I think the project is cool. So whatever I'm helping with, it's actually important to me that I like it. Just some stuff I hadn't really realized until now.</p>
<h3>Job Interview</h3>
<p>I had a job interview yesterday and I don't think I got the job. I'm supposed to wait for an email next week to see if I make it to second round interview, but I feel like I won't make it. Either way, I'm fine with whatever happens. I still have my current job and I like it. And, the thought of using my art skills for money is inching closer to reality. I can only go up from where I am, so I'm very happy.</p>
<h3>Avatar</h3>
<p>I have now finished watching Avatar: The Last Airbender. It was really good. One of my favorite things now. I would classify it under the category "media that makes you good." I kind of wanted to write a whole review on it, but I think it wouldn't be very interesting. It's kind of just good at everything it does. I'd love to have conversations about it, but just writing a long thingy thing doesn't sound like as much fun. All that I mean to say right now is that I loved it, and I'd recommend it to anyone interested.</p>

<p>Thanks for checking in on the blog. I gain nothing from people reading but it feels weird to not thank people. Anyways, hope you have a great week! bruahsani</p>
