<h2>Spore finale and such</h2>
<p class="date">11/28/22</p>
<p>Spore 3 is out and you can watch it on <a href="https://youtu.be/fV43AbRgOhk" rel="noopener"target="_blank">YouTube</a>. This is the final highlight video made from my live playthrough of Spore.</p>
<p>I've add a project page for my <a href="https://flare145.com/projects/deathmatch_classic_refragged"rel="noopener"target="_blank">achievement icons</a>. </p>
<p>I started writing this post and realized I don't have much to say right now. Besides work and school, I kind of don't know what I'm going to get up to. I think the next thing for me to work on would be the Trinket Trouble behind the scenes I mention all of the time, but I don't know where to start on that at the moment. Plus I've got some extra time. I think I might just keep vibing for now. Gonna watch some stuff I've been wanting to watch. That's probably just my mood for today though. Can't go long without wanting to create something. There's like a billion project pages I have to make now so I can always fall back on that if I'm bored. </p>
<p>Okay bye I've got to go research computer parts again. Hopefully I can do some small upgrades soon.</p>
