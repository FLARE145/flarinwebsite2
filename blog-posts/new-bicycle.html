<p>Hi! You might remember that I spent my last post mourning the loss of my bicycle. Well I bought a new one now so... </p>

<p>I spent a lot of money on this actually, so I'm a little scared it has a higher likelihood of being stolen. But yeah it's a really good bike. It is everything I was looking for. Not a whole lot more to say about it. I will be riding to work on this today, so I'm very excited. </p>
<p>I apologize for suddenly flexing, I will get back to posting about lame stuff after this. See you all then</p>
