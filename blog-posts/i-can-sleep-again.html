<p>It has become very difficult for me do work on my personal projects these days. I effectively have maybe 2 hours of free time a day, which is a good amount, but I'm too tired to use it effectively. My current self-improvement goal is to become better at maximizing my time, and I've historically never been super good at that. Also conflicting with my productivity is family trips. This time of year, I get dragged around to hike or camp. I love it, but when my weekend is the only time to make good progress on my own stuff, it sucks to "lose" these weekends.</p>
<p>But yeah, I sleep really well now. I guess that's what a consistent schedule does to you. Working at random times any given day sometimes at minutes notice was not enjoyable, and I didn't really realize that until now. It was nice to have free time though, and I did enjoy that aspect. My assumption is also that I never did enough in a day to truly be tired before. Now, I could probably sleep as soon as I'm home if I wanted to, but I stay awake to try to do cool things or bluesky. </p>
<p>I haven't been making progress on commission work which is pretty bad, but I hope to catch up soon. I'm also working on getting things moving for Boxkid chapter 2. Switching to Linux has kind of made working on it strange since I relied a lot on my Windows software to plan ch2. I decided to continue the planning phase on paper, like I did with the first chapter. So yesterday, I spent like an hour making my printer work on Linux, then I printed out what I have so far of the ch2 rough draft. I gave it a read and it's looking pretty good. Some small changes I need to take care of, but that's why it's a rough draft. I'm hopefully going to continue working on it in these coming days if I find the strength.</p>
<p>This week is pretty exciting because I get to go to a concert for the first time. I'm going to see Nine Inch Nails with my friend MTD in a few days so I guess say hi if you see me lol. I'm honestly not the kind of person you would expect to enjoy a concert, but I'm down to try new things and such. Especially since I've defeated the guiltâ„¢ (dark playground), </p>
<p>Random but I also kind of feel like streaming again but I'm not sure I will. I just wonder if maybe that would be a good way to force myself to do something with my short afternoons. I'm thinking like drawing streams where I draw pomni and such. That'd be cool maybe. 4 hours down the drain to whatever rabbit hole Linux takes me on to get that to work though.</p>
<p>The more okay I feel, the more concerned I feel with trying to help other people get here. Not sure what I can do yet though. I think maybe streaming could have something to do with that, or maybe Boxkid? I think Boxkid is just gonna be melodramatic for a long while though, not really inspirational. We'll see. I. Just. Gotta. Lock. In.</p>
