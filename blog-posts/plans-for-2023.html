<p class="date">1/2/23</p>
<p>Wow I haven't posted since last year. HAHAHA get it? Well anyways I haven't posted much because I keep falling asleep. </p>
<p>Okay uh so this year uh... Well fost I want to say that I delayed the Trinket Trouble bts again. Kind of not a surprise. I won't mention it for a while now. I don't think anything else is delayed though. So that means...</p>
<p>Fun Friday! Its actually happening for reals now! This Friday will be the first actual episode, but there will be a channel update video before that. I have no idea how the series is going to turn out but at least it will exist.</p>
<p>As for any animations I might make, Rainbow should come out this year. It was supposed to be last year but yeah. I've made some more progress that I haven't shared so hopefully I can show it off soon.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how often streams are gonna be this year. I was doing weekly streams last year for a bit and I don't think that will happen again. Its just a matter of how busy I am though. This year I will be streaming the Half-Life episodes and random art stuff too. I actually might stream a paid commission really soon. Speed Render, the live show I announced last year, probably won't happen this year either. Just setting expectations low you know. It would be cool if I did do it though because then I could say I made 2 shows this year. We'll see.</p>
<p>I'm really starting to like the website. This year I will make a bunch of project pages for all of my projects that aren't there yet. I also hope to make those art page changes I've been talking about for a while. </p>
<p>I feel like I'm in a better position this year to make some cool stuff than I was at this time last year. Trying to focus on a very small number of things this time around. Let's see how far I make it before I try to start like 5 more projects at the same time. </p>
