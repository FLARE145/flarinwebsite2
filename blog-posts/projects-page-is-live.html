<p class="date">11/22/22</p>
<p>Okay the <a href="https://flare145.com/projects" rel="noopener" target="_blank">projects page</a> is now linked on the main page. The icon for it might be change slightly but it's good enough for now. Even though I planned to remove the links tile, I managed to keep it thanks to some crazy changes I made to the style of the page. It's a bit strange on mobile right now but I'll get to fixing it.</p>
<p>Also related to website changes, the art page looks slightly different if you are on experimental mode. There's now a toggle that lets you choose between featured art and all art. It doesn't make a difference right now because featured art still shows all of it anyways. The plan is to make a section called series that will let you sort between different groups of artwork, but that will take a while to make so the toggle is staying in experimental for now.</p>
<p>Last bit of news, I posted a <a href="https://flare145.com/artwork/ng011" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new artwork</a> to the site. I knew I could draw at least one more thing before the end of the year, but now I've gotta aim for two.</p>
<p>I've got some busy days ahead. I'm joining someone on a journey to go back in time to the first Thanksgiving to get turkeys off the menu, so I might be gone for a while.</p>
