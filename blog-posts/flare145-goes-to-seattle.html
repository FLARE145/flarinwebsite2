<p class="date">9/20/25</p>
<p>Or Washington more specifically I guess. I stayed in Port Angeles for about 4 days, and I mostly was visiting Olympic National Park. My sister is a huge national park fan so I get dragged out on trips like this, which tend to be enjoyable but they do cut into my time which I’m increasingly more concerned about. I spent the first day mostly in Seattle where I landed, and that was awesome too. Really cool place. I took some pictures on the trip so I thought it would be cool to post just a few here (I took way too many to properly edit). There’s some cool art I wish I took more pictures of, but maybe it’s better that I didn’t. It’s best experienced in person because the art really feels like it belongs there. That’s all from me today, so I’ll leave you with these photos. See ya!</p>
