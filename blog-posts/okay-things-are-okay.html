<p class="date">1/28/22</p>
<p>I'm going to start by apologizing for this more personal post. I always try to prioritize talking about my creative work because that's what I want this blog to be for the most part. However, I throw these in because my life effects my work and also because I like to indulge my vanity sometimes.</p>
<p>All I wanted to say today is that school went better than I thought it would, which is really nice. Makes me feel a bit better about life. If I like the stuff I make for this semester's art class, I'll probably post it here. Unfortunately these works will use up all of my creative free time, but the reward of improving as an artist is worth it.</p>
<p>Still, I can't wait until summer. I can't wait to get back to working on entertaining stuff.</p>
