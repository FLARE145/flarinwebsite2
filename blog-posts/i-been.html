<p>You know what, I been doing alright. Let me see if I can muster up any news for the day.</p>
<p>Fun Friday has been my main focus for the past month. I think that creatively speaking, it's all I can handle while also doing school. For the most part, they only take me a day. Unfortunately though, that one day takes up most of my creative free time. This week I managed to squeeze in a stream, so hopefully as I get more used to this semester, I can start doing other stuff again.</p>
<p>Oh shoot wow it's been a while since I've written one of these so I actually do have news. I started a new website! The official <a href="https://funfriday.flare145.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fun Friday</a> website! It mostly just exists for my own personal convenience, but It is really easy to make that stuff public so I figured I might as well. It just has all the weird html css js stuff I've made for the show so far. I'll put more stuff on the site if I have more ideas, but there isn't any plans for it at all. In fact, I don't even plan on styling it at all, which is a bit sad because I think the show has a distinct style that could translate over. I'm just not doing it because it's not necessary. I'd rather work on my main website.</p>
<p>I would talk some more on like random stuff but I really just want to post something asap. While I don't have more FLARE145 news to talk about, I still have various off topic things I might post about. I hope you been well and I'll be back soon!</p>
