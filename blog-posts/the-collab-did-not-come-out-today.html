<p class="date">10/28/22</p>
<p>So I know I hyped it up yesterday, but Toy Story 2 Redialed has been delayed another 2 days. I will post an update again when it happens for real.</p>
<p>In other news, I just beat my personal record for longest stream. I just did a live stream that lasted 7:40:32, which is longer than "happy boi eats chocolate" at 7:11:34. I will hopefully beat it again with a better stream someday.</p>
<p>I spent the stream making more DMCR achievement icons. I only have like 5 more to create, then I can get into the final stages of making them. I see the light at the end of the tunnel. Okay I'm hella tired so bye</p>
