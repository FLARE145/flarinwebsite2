<p class="date">8/4/21</p>
<p>I've gotten incredibly good at wasting time. I'm supposed to be animating for the animation jam, but I guess I have very low expectations of this one because I can't seem to stay focused for more than 30 minutes at a time. I almost fell asleep 3 times today so thats cool for time. I was actually listening to a podcast today where the hosts were discussing different forms of time wasting and it felt super relevant to my life. Fun coincidence. At least I'm still getting work done, even if its slow.</p>
