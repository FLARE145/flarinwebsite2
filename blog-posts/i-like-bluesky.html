<p class="date">10/1/24</p>
<p>I've been using bluesky again since the user base recently grew (twitter got banned in Brazil) and I really enjoy it.</p>
<p>It feels much less cluttered. There isn't blue check bot account replies for me to shift through. Just actual posts from actual people. Another bonus is that because of the relatively smaller user base, I don't ever feel like a clout chaser. My posts are there just because. For some reason, tweeting on twitter always feels like I'm trying to get something out of it. It's like a weird 'in my mind' thing but I can't get rid of the feeling. On bluesky, I know my posts will reach the five people who follow me and I'm happy with that.</p>
<p>I'm a little sad that it seems a lot of people want bluesky to fail. The term <em>fediverse</em> has just recently changed to not include bluesky. My understanding is that it basically just refers to ActivityPub, which I think is pretty lame. Bluesky is the simplest microblogging experience right now, so I'm going to be sticking with it. Maybe I'll jump ship later, but posting on Bluesky is a lot of fun right now.</p>
<p>See you later. Follow me on the thingy if you haven't </p>
