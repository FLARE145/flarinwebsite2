<p class="date">6/29/25</p>
<p>This week, I've suddenly found the motivation to try to make quick progress on things I'd like to get done. Right now, my personal project priorities are Boxkid chapter 2, and then RSS Plaza. Before that, I still need to finish another logo commission, so that has even higher priority. I've devised a small experiment that might help me in being more productive this week.</p>
<p>I'm not letting myself use Discord or Bluesky this week. At least until Saturday. I predict that this will lead me to spend more time working and gaming, and the hope is that I have the will to force myself to work more than game. I'm not completely stopping myself from opening Discord because I need it to talk to my commission client, but I will be refraining from using it any more than I have to.</p>
<p>I might be making more posts here because of boredom. We'll see. I'll make sure to make a post at the end at least to go over the results of this. Wish me luck!</p>
