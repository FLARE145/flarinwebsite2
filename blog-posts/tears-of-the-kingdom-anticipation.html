<p class="date">3/27/23</p>
<p>The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild is one of my favorite games of all time. I happened to play it around a sucky part of my life so it was very influential in my life. So, you might be able to imagine just how much a sequel to this game means to me.</p>
<p>I would like to point out that I never wanted this game to get a sequel. I'm glad there is one, but it was never necessary. As such, I generally don't really have high expectations for the game. I will just take it as it is. But, considering just how little they've shown of the game, and how much the producer hypes it up, it would be wrong of me to say that I'm not excited to see what has been cooking for all ~5 years of development. </p>
<p>I will probably stream my live reaction or something. As much as I don't feel like streaming, it only makes sense that I do it this time. This is like the most excited I could get about anything. Oh, sorry I didn't even explain what is going on. Nintendo is supposed to show 10 minutes of Tears of the Kingdom gameplay tomorrow. So yeah. I'm excited. Excited enough to make a post on here. Without any proof-reading as well. I'm bored of typing now so bye</p>
