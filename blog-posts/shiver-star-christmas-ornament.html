<p>Similar to the pumpkin I decorated for Halloween at work, I've decorated an ornament for Christmas. I had multiple ideas for how to decorate it, but I completely ran out of time! I ended up with just 1 day to work on it, but thankfully, I came up with a new idea that didn't require much effort.</p>

<p>The idea is "Earth frozen over." I was inspired by the Kirby 64 level <em>Shiver Star</em>. The level is well known by Kirby fans because of the implication that this is what happened to Earth in the Kirby cannon. I have no idea how well that holds now that the forgotten land is a thing. I'm not a real Kirby fan, I've just absorbed Kirby-ness through people around me, so I really like Kirby. I hope you don't look too closely at my globe though because I'm like, very bad at geography.</p>

<p>Oh btw I streamed again? I just realized I didn't mention that on here. It happened last week maybe. Honestly I'm super tired rn so I'll write about it later. See ya</p>
