<a href="https://flare145.com/blogpost?=website-anniversary"rel="noopener"style="text-decoration:none;"><h2>Website anniversary</h2></a>
<p class="date">7/27/22</p>
<p>I'm going to be honest, I haven't been feeling very well lately. I was actually meaning to say something about it earlier, but I've decided that the details of my depression are not something I want to discuss on here. </p>
<p>There was a time, about a year ago, when I felt proud to be myself. This is no longer the case, but I'm working towards being that person again. I'm not done here. I'm not going to let my mistakes weigh me down. I'm going to be positive, and I want to bring that positivity to as many people as I can.</p>
<p>One year ago, I created this website. It's come a long way since then, and I'm sure it has a long way to go. This website is the hub for everything that I want to put into the world. That's why it's important to me. I am in no mood for celebration, but I will at least acknowledge that I'm surprised I've made decent use of this website. I hope that one day, it can represent something I'm proud of.</p>
<p>I'm ending this post with a small announcement. As I said earlier, I'm working on being more positive. I'm trying to feel better about life in general. I'm trying to have a little more fun. And as I go on this journey, I want to bring others along with me. So I invite you, if you have time of course. How does Friday sound?</p>
