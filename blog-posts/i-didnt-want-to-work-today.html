<h2>I didn't want to work today!</h2>
<p class="date">10/4/22</p>
<p>So since I started working, I have mostly prefered to be at work. I know that's like the least relatable sentence ever, but I found a surprising number of people who seem to share the same feelings I have towards work. That is, its really nice to escape the problems of your life and just slip into your work persona. Turns out I'm not the only person with a surprisingly dark and heavy burden. Its nice to know I wasn't completely alone in that.</p>
<p>Anyways, something crazy happened today. I didn't want to go to work. More specifically, I didn't want to go because I wanted to work on something creative. This is kind of big for me because I realize that I'm subconsciously allowing myself to indulge in my interests again. </p>
<p>I'm just bored so sorry for rambling about whatever. I'm actually typing this during my break at work. Nothing much to do.</p>
<p>Oh also I beat Half-Life 2. Isn't that crazy? I'm probably gonna continue with the episodes, but I'd like to focus on making more DMCR achievement icons first. I'm in the headspace for it and I don't want to lose that energy. </p>
<p>More posts to come very soon. Probably gonna react to that Mario trailer on Thursday. Well break is mostly over and I must go now bye</p>
