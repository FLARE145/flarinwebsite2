<p class="date">5/6/24</p>
<p>I've been working my normal job a lot lately, and progress on everything else has been slow. More of a me week I guess. But, I do have one interesting little update. I got a new chair! I still have my other ones, so I thought it would be fun to do a little side by side sort of thing.</p>

<p>I got it for $40 dollars at a yard sale. Barely used, and it's a really good chair. I've been having to use an extra pillow as support when I hurt my back recently, but this chair already has a little thingy that acts like that pillow. It's so cool. I can also make it recline back, which I've never cared about before, but it's nice. The arm rests are adjustable and it's generally just comfortable. My other one is a little broken too, so that's also why I wanted a new one.</p>
<p>Now that I think of it, I should have made a post about my new mouse. I recently upgraded to the Logitech MX Master 3S and it has changed my digital life. Very good mouse. Not much else to say about it. I had a HyperX for the longest time that was a gift, but I had to get a new one because the middle click broke.</p>
<p>That's all for today. I hope to be a little more productive this week so I'll talk about how that goes next time. See ya!</p>
