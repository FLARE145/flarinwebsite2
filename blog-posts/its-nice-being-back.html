          <h2>It's nice being back</h2>
          <p class="date">5/25/22</p>
          <p>Yesterday was my first stream in a long time, and while it was pretty rough, I'm glad that I could do it again. I will be streaming a lot now that I have some free time. The plan right now is to knock out HL2 so I can get on with other things.</p>
          <p>Also, I finally finished that one artwork from forever ago. I'm talking about the one I showed progress of in <a href="https://flare145.com/blogpost?=last-day-of-the-year">this blog post</a>. I believe I started working on it back in early December, but the original drawing is even older. But yeah, here is the finished <a href="https://flare145.com/artwork/ng009">artwork</a> if you want to check it out.</p>
          <p>Something I forgot to mention in the last post is that I've been way more active on Twitter throughout my little break. I intend to keep posting doodles about as frequently as I have been. It's nice to be able to share little thingys instead of full finished pieces.</p>
          <p>That's all the news for today. I'll make more posts as I figure out what the plan is with projects like Speed Render. Okay bye and be sure to catch the streams if you are interested.</p>
