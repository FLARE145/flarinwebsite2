<p class="date">11/24/24</p>
<p>It's very common for people to get sad over fake things that never happened, but I'm experiencing the opposite and it's kind of awesome.</p>
<p>I love watching movies and shows. I even enjoy books again. Fictional stories. They're so good at making me feel good. I don't know when everything got so good. It's really easy to just ignore stuff that sucks or isn't good, so it seems like everything is peak to me. Even the baby media is good these days because of stuff like Bluey. There's so much human creativity everywhere. So many ways to connect to the experiences of others. MUSIC. Old and new. It's all so good.</p>
<p>It's easier to enjoy these things when you consider the creator. Even if something kind of sucks, you can look at it from the authors perspective. It's usually possible to see what they were getting at, and be impressed by it in some way. When there's many people involved, the overall product has the potential to become incredible through everyone's effort, or it can also suck because of some people's bad contributions. It's still possible to identify the good and enjoy it.</p>
<p>The crazy thing is that once you understand this, you can apply it to everything. People are created by their circumstance and their own effort. They are influenced, good or bad, by others. There are so many good people, and even when someone sucks, there are still bits and pieces you can love.</p>
<p>However, thinking like this is a bit of a crutch if you want to learn to love. I believe that the ultimate form of love is unconditional, and what I described previously is very conditional. I do think it's an important stepping stone to getting there though. At least I hope so. I want to become someone who loves everyone, unconditionally, all the time. I think my life has put me in a position where that is possible, and I'm very thankful for that.</p>
<p>I love so much. I don't know what I'm supposed to do with it though. Like, how can I make others experience what I do. I'm stumped at the moment. I know things I can do to make people happy, but I don't know how to change what makes people happy. And I don't know if I should be the one to attempt changing people in any way. Idk. If you read this and had ideas, let me know. Or maybe you can try them yourself. There's only one worst person and one best person. We can always help, or be helped. Idk. Sorry if I sound like I think I'm all-knowing and peaceful and stuff because I'm not. I'm flawed and hateful to a degree. But I'm trying to be better, and this is the longest I've tried in a while. I'll stop rambling for now. Thanks and see ya</p>
<p>You can tell I didn't have to work today</p>
