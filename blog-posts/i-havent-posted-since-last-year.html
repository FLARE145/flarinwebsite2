<p class="date">1/1/26</p>
<p>I haven't posted in a year (╥﹏╥)...     get itt...</p>
<p>Honestly I have a lot to talk about but I don't care enough to write about it lately. Maybe I'll catch up on posting during these break days I have. Anyways, today is the first day of 2026, so I figured I'd do a quick <em>state of FLARE145</em> going into this new year.</p>
<h3>2025 review</h3>
<p>At the top of the year I laid out some of my <a href="https://flare145.com/blogpost?=good-morning-2025" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2025 plans</a>, and I pretty much accomplished most of it. I finished animated a new Coaxion game intro, although it won't be seen publicly until a game comes out. I'm really happy with how it came out and I can't wait for people to see it. I worked on a number of logo commissions so that was cool. Unfortunately, I did not accomplish my main goal, which was to release another chapter of Boxkid. For half of the year, I've been working full-time which has greatly hindered my progress.</p>
<p>In 2025, I also started to work on RSS Plaza, which is now on the back burner. I started streaming again in December for the first time in a while, and I'm thinking of continuing. I've also just started a new short animated project, but I will likely drop it entirely to focus more on Boxkid soon. We'll see.</p>
<h3>2026 Plans</h3>
<p>Okay. My only real goal is to release Boxkid chapter 2. My far out goal is 3 more chapters, so that would mean ch2 - ch4. That's my far out goal, so unlikely to happen. Otherwise, yeah I'd love to get back to RSS Plaza at some point, but I suspect I won't until 2027 at the earliest. Again, we'll see. So yeah that's pretty much it. As I stated before, I'm currently working on an animation, but I'm not sure I'm gonna follow through with it as it's really unoriginal and just for fun and practice.</p>
<p>Oh I guess maybe I'll animate on <a href="https://coaxion.games/?=the_espionage_project" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TEP</a> this year? I don't get the feeling animation on that will start until 2027 at the earliest. Still need all of voice acting to happen and storyboard and models rigs etc. I'm hoping that's not going to be too annoying of a project to work on. I haven't really animated on something like, for someone else and with other people. If the process bothers me more than it is fun, I would probably quit, so here's to hoping everything works out.</p>
<h3>Closing thoughts</h3>
<p>This year will be a test of how much I am willing to sacrifice to do the things I want to do. The easy part is sacrificing my own time, but the hard part is not being there for other people. At the end of this year, I will know how strong I am.</p>
<p>That's all for 2025. I'll miss that number because I think it's cool. Later</p>
