<p class="date">10/1/21</p>
<p>And its time to wake up</p>
<p>Anyways, today is the first day that my campus is officially reopened, and I am currently typing this in the library. I've already been going to campus twice a week for a drawing class because it was exempt from the schools online policy. Now I have to go for two other classes as well.</p>
<p>Honestly I'm kind of hyped for this month. Its looking like I'm getting back on track with my work which should give me enough free time to watch Over the Garden Wall again. I also just like the fall weather. I get to wear sweaters again.</p>
<p>Okay my teacher is talking about actual important stuff now so bye.</p>
