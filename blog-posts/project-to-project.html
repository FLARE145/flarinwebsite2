<p>Hey! It's been a second. Last time I made a blog post was for the release of Boxkid, which went about as I expected. I got a decent number of views on Newgrounds and my friends finally got to see what I took so long to make. I can't wait to write the next chapter. Although, I can actually wait because I've been working on a number of other things first.</p>
<p>First, I had to finish up a logo commission. Very happy with it as I usually am. It's always fun to do those so I'm considering making a more public post about what I offer. Maybe on Bluesky or Newgrounds. And second, I've been working on another intro for Coaxion. The first one I made was my own idea, and it's not going to be used as the intro for their games. I was sent a mockup of what the game intro should feel like a long time ago, but I'm only now getting around to working on it. I actually completely finish one before, but then I had a better idea for it so I had to restart.</p>

<p>This has been fun to work on, but quite time consuming. I'm trying to get it done quick because there are other things I'd like to work on for myself during my maybe last month of free time. Although in terms of cool visual stuff, this is probably the last thing I get to make for a long time. The projects I want to get to after this are more programming stuff for myself than cool stuff for others to look at.</p>
<p>A while back, I made a program in Python to generate <em>bro ball images</em>. Well, I thought it would be cool to make an android version of it to run on mobile. It seems like it might not be too much work, so I'm looking into it after this Coaxion animation. After that, I really want to get back to learning C. I don't remember if I mentioned this on the blog, but I started to experiment with C by making a password manager. I may never finish this project, but I still really want to get back to it as I didn't have the time to give it a fair shot. Then I might remake it in python lol.</p>
<p>And of course, there's the next chapter of Boxkid. Honestly, I might skip over the programming stuff I want to do and just go straight to drawing Boxkid. I know people would probably be happier about that, and if I don't do it now, I have no idea how long it could take. It kinda sucks because at first, Boxkid was supposed to be the thing I can work on with little effort. An amalgamation of concepts from other ideas in my head that didn't work. I didn't foresee that people would care and now I'm forced to care as well. I guess it's for the best, but if I knew I'd be putting this much effort in, I probably would have chosen to start working on a different big project idea. Because this was supposed to be small project idea. Oh well. It's probably for the best. This was always going to happen anyways because I don't like making stuff I'm not proud of. Plus, I probably can put in less effort now. Doing the prologue might have skewed my view on how much time this takes. We shall see.</p>
<p>That's pretty much it. All that said, I'm still in one of the happiest states of my life. I've been applying to a lot of jobs lately and while I'm not so confident things will work out, I can feel good about trying my best. I hope you all have a wonderful day and I'll see ya later</p>
