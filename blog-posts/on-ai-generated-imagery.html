<p>The world is about to tell me that I am worth nothing. That my skills are simply not valuable. That the person I fought to become is a person that is not useful. I am an artist. I am an artist because I can't possibly be anything else. I'm not skilled enough, knowledgeable enough, or talented enough at anything else. Art is simply the thing I'm least bad at. But it turns out that doesn't matter. Because at some point, we stopped caring about the artist. We only care about the product. I only care about the product.</p>
<p>And now we can make art without the artist. Visuals. Stories. Expressions. Whatever we considered exclusive to humanity, it can be automated. Sure, it's not genuine expression, but that doesn't matter to most people. For the most part, it doesn't matter to me. I care about how a movie makes me feel. I don't care if it's just the same tropes I'm used to seeing. We've always been imitating ourselves. And now a computer can do that. So did the artist ever even matter?</p>
<p>I'm an imitation machine. I like it when I think I've made something. There are people that like it too, but there are people that like everything. And there's about to be a lot more everything than artists.</p>
<p>I hate myself. It sucks and I hate that I have to say that whenever I choose to be honest. But despite that, I have to care about myself. I have to because there's other people that care about me. So, it would be really nice if I could make a living by being me. It would be nice if my skills were valuable enough to support me financially. But that won't ever be the case. And I'm okay with that. I'd like everyone to know that I am okay with that. I will make money when I can, but my art is my expression. You can take attention away from me, but you can't take me.</p>
<p>If you care about anything I make, thank you. You don't have to. If you care about me, the artist, thank you. You don't have to. I care about my art too. And I care about myself. I will try to make a living by being me. And when that doesn't work, I will be me until I am no longer living.</p>
<p>Who I am is mostly worthless to most people, but honestly I don't really care.</p>
