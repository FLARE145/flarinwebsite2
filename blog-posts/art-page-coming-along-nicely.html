<p class="date">11/6/21</p>
<p>The page is looking good except mobile viewing is still a bit weird. Don't know if I'll be able to fix it. Honestly I would link it on the main page already but I still need to make the icon for it. Also it would be nice if I got the text descriptions done before that as well.</p>
<p>Other news, I really gotta get some homework done so blog posts shall go back to being infrequent. Or maybe not. They might just get really weird again. Or you know what, maybe I can post some doodles. </p>
<p>It's settled. If I remember to take pictures of them, I'll start posting some things I've drawn recently.</p>
