<p>I was a big fan of Don’t Hug Me I’m Scared, so I was really happy to hear that a second series had finally found a producer. For those who might not know, DHMIS was a video series on youtube created by Joseph Pelling, Rebecca Sloan, and Baker Terry. To be totally honest, I don’t remember this Baker Terry person, but google says they worked on it so they have my full respect. Anyways, the original series ran from 2011 to 2016. It was six episodes that probably averaged a five minute run time. The show followed a cast of puppets as they underwent various horrors in a setting that mimics all kinds of children shows.

<p>I remember when the first one came out, it was like this big viral thing. People would show it to each other in hopes of scaring the other person. It was pretty effective because it really does nail the complete innocence at the beginning. Later episodes were more focused on the message, rather than this basic twist. Similarly, the new show was going to have to put less focus on horror as well. A pilot for a new series was created in 2019, but few people have seen it since it was just shown at a film festival. I’ve seen most of it because someone hooked me up with a phone recorded version, but that experience was not ideal. The pilot was setting up a story centric version of dhmis which felt very different, but still fresh. However, the show wouldn’t find a producer until years later. The series would air on Channel 4 and be available for streaming on All 4, a streaming service unavailable in the US. Thankfully I found it online. I will find a way for my support to reach the creators eventually.</p>
<p>So what do I think about the new episodes? I definitely very like it. DHMIS continues to be one of my favorite things, and I think I like it even more than I did before. With six episodes at twenty minutes long, the new show now makes up a majority of DHMIS. It’s clear that the creators are prioritizing entertainment over meaning, and I mean that as a compliment. It’s a very funny show. I would highly recommend you watch it if you liked the originals at all. I’d rate it a 9/10. Rating systems aren’t great but just know I really liked it and you should watch it.</p>
