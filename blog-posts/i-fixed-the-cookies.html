<h2>I fixed the cookies</h2>
<p class="date">10/11/22</p>
<p>So it took me a long while to figure out the cookie system on my website was kind of broken, and it took me even longer to figure out why. I think I finally fixed it today. It should actually remember the newsbar preference and experimental settings now.</p>
<p>Also of note, I added new artwork to the art page. Its the <a href="https://flare145.com/artwork/ng010" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Lil Square painting</a> from the Spore video. Probably one of the better things on there now. I should get rid of the stuff I'm not as proud of. Or at least I might restructure the page to have like a featured section or something. </p>
<p>See yall later I got more homework to do bye</p>
