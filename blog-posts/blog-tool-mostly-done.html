          <h2>Blog tool mostly done</h2>
		  <p class="date">11/4/21</p>
          <p>I've finished adding all the functionality I said was missing from my blog post writing tool. Now that that's done, today I started work on what I should have done a long time ago. I'm working on an actual art page.</p>
          <p>The plan is to have a grid of images that you can click on and see details about. Each piece an informational blurb as well as links to everywhere its been posted. At the moment, I'm not very far into development, but it's still looking pretty good in my opinion.</p>
          <p>I might show some pictures of my progress soon because I'm too lazy to take screenshots right now.</p>
