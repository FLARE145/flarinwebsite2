<p class="date">4/15/24</p>
<p>I'm somehow still sick. It's not as bad but I take really long naps now. Especially after work. I haven't worked on a whole lot and frankly I'm a bit of a mess right now. I'm hoping to get things back together this week but everyday I work is an other day I feel defeated. At least I like working, it just sucks being so tired when there is so much I want to do.</p>
<p>No real updates on anything. I've mostly been trying to catch up on the gaming backlog, which right now means playing a lot of Links Awakening on my Miyoo Mini. I have plenty of thoughts on many things but no real energy to talk about them right now. </p>
<p>Despite all the sickness and naps, I'm feeling pretty good. Thinking about the future and stuff, there isn't too much more I can do to help myself other than what I'm already doing. I'm resting right now because my body needs it, but I'm feeling quite motivated to continue all of my artistic endeavors. The ride will be slow and uninteresting, but I love it. bruahsani</p>
