<p class="date">1/18/24</p>
<p>If you don't follow me too closely, which is unlikely considering you are reading my blog, this title must appear rather frightening. However, I can assure you that there is no reason to feel alarmed.</p>
<p>I recently went live drawing my first furry fanart. It was of <a href="https://flare145.com/artwork/ng012" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kimiko Five-Tails</a>. I was surprised when I realized I've never drawn a furry, so I wanted to get my first one right. I think I succeeded and now the doors are open for me to make money. I probably won't though. Advertising commissions is hard I think.</p>
<p>In other news, I added another batch of artwork to the art page. You can check it out by going to the <a href="https://flare145.com/art/series?=funfridayendstills" rel="noopener" target="_blank">series tab</a>. I've added all of the endstills from Fun Friday. Endstill is the word I use to refer to the funky image at the end of each FF episode. They are pretty cool so I thought they should go up on the site. Plus, I'm having a hard time figuring out how to categorize more of my work, and this was an easy category to add. Oh yeah and this does mean that I have migrated the full artwork images off of github. They are all hosted on google now so I have to worry less about storage.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading. I just felt the need to somewhat document this particular event. I don't like how I end most of these posts, so I think I'm just going to charge up the word bruahsani. I'm going to end this post by saying that, but know that in this context, I want bruahsani to symbolize an entire goodbye. It's hard to explain what I mean. I guess kind of like an amen. Anyways, bruahsani</p>
