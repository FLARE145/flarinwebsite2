<p class="date">10/9/22</p>
<p>This actually happened a good while ago now. In June, I went on the <a href="https://offthewallshow.newgrounds.com/"rel="noopener"target="_blank">Off the Wall</a> podcast with <a href="https://thatjohnnyguy.newgrounds.com/"rel="noopener"target="_blank">ThatJohnnyGuy</a>. At the time, I really wanted to get into interacting with more people online, so it was a well-timed opportunity.</p>
<p>I've actually been too afraid to listen back to the whole thing, so I don't know how well it actually turned out. I assume that it comes across as pretty rambley because of the raw sort of style the show has. I had intended to talk about some strange funny stories of mine, but we ended up going through my animation work and stuff. I feel like I probably sound either full of myself, or really boring. I'm not sure anything I said was valuable or interesting. In any case, it was still fun and I'm grateful for the experience.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I did this like right before some life-shaking stuff happened, so I didn't end up talking about the podcast here on my blog. Or anywhere else I think? Anyways yeah, doing a lot better now so that's nice. I'd really love to get back to interacting with people again like I had intended to. There's still a lot I have to do before I can get to that though.</p>
<p>Hope you enjoy the <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/1140896"rel="noopener"target="_blank">podcast episode</a> if you choose to listen to it. Idk what my next blog post will be because I kind of can't work on a lot right now. See you when I remember something interesting to talk about</p>
