<p class="date">7/15/24</p>
<p>I've been pretty inactive lately because my attention was focused on family that was visiting for a few weeks. Still, I managed to do a couple things in that time.</p>
<p>Commissions! I mentioned this quite a long while ago now. I made a logo for <a href="https://twitter.com/DirectorsCutMod" rel="nopener" target="_blank">Directors Cut</a>. It's like a cool filmmaking thing for the Source engine. Check it out if you're into Source things.</p>
<p>I also made a logo for <a href="https://www.moddb.com/company/rogue-lambda" rel="nopener" target="_blank">Rogue Lambda</a>, a Source modding group. Check it out to see what they work on.</p>
<p>With these new gigs over with, I decided to re work my <a href="https://flare145.com/portfolio" rel="nopener" target="_blank">portfolio page</a>. It looks a bit nicer now and includes newer stuff. Also removed some things. I think there's more examples I want to add but I'll leave it for now.</p>
<p>Now onto some life updates. I think I might get a full time job early next year. Not giving details but its sorta a construction job. Given this information, I feel a lot more relaxed about my art stuff. Like I don't need my art to sustain me, because it won't be my job. I'll still do commissions because its cool though. But yeah, I can make my art at my own pace and do what I want. Boxkid and Axo are the projects I want to work on, although I still have a lot on my plate for Coaxion to get through. Hoping I can get to the point someday where I just have my own stuff to worry about.</p>
<p>So yeah, things are looking okay for now. I'll see you next time, hopefully with some good news on my projects. Bye!</p>
