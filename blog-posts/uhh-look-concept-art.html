<p>Here is a low res look at the concept for my current animation project.</p>

<img src="/blogimages/012422rainbow.png" alt="A drawing of a man and a rainbow" style="width:60vmin; display:inline; max-width:790px;">

</figure>
<p>This animation should be very short. Like we're talking somewhere around 10 seconds. It's still gonna take a while though because I'm trying to make the character rig easily reusable.</p>
<p>I would have made a longer blog post but I don't feel like it right now. I'm up later than usual because I lost track of time while drawing a different thing. So yeah. I'll talk more about this project later but bye for now</p>
