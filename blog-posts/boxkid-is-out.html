<p>Yesterday, the first two chapters of Boxkid finally came out. I meant to make this post yesterday, but it slipped my mind in all the excitement. </p>

<p>Overall, the launch went really well. I was worried there would be issues with the website, but it seems like everyone who used it didn't run into problems. The comic didn't get much attention, but that was expected with this project. I'm more excited than ever to make a chapter 2, but I have some other obligations to get through first. In the mean time, make sure to check out <a href="https://boxkid.net" rel="nopener" target="_blank">boxkid</a>. Thanks for reading and see ya</p>
