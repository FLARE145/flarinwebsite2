<p class="date">4/7/24</p>
<p>Warning: This post will be very scattered and maybe personal? We'll see where it goes but I just got a lot on the mind right now.</p>
<p>So I'm sick right now and have been for almost a week. This really disrupted a lot of my plans and has caused delays on all of my projects. I've been trying to rest as much as I can because this is the worst I've gotten sick in a while. Like I haven't had fever in years so that felt pretty crazy to me. Kinda fun honestly.</p>
<p>I've been watching a lot of Avatar The Last Airbender, and man it's a really good show. I never saw it when I was younger, and I'm kind of glad? I'm happy that I get to experience this now with my full ability to appreciate good art. It's wonderful, and I find myself so drawn to the character of Zuko. I think in general, I connect the most with redemption stories, since I feel a strong need to redeem myself in my life. It's like I saw it at the perfect time for it to have maximum impact on me. The story is simple and the themes are not new to me, but sometimes you just need things repeated to you until it hits.</p>
<p>I've talked a little before about my hatred towards myself, and I'd rather not mention it again, but I've made a small improvement in myself that I think is worth mentioning. One of the ways my hatred shows itself is my inability to celebrate myself. I don't like my birthday because I don't like the idea of people celebrating me. I typically hate it when people go out of their way to tell me happy birthday, because I know I don't deserve that. But recently, I've been inspired to change myself. It has been hard for me to change, but something happened that is evidence that I have. My coworkers bought me a birthday cake, and it made me really happy. It made me really happy that these people with no obligation to do anything for me, all got together to get me cake and a nice card. I tried my hardest to make sure they didn't know my birthday, and they refused to let that be the case. Typically, I would hate this. I hate that people care about me because I don't want to care about myself. But, as I'm actively working on beginning to care about myself, I can finally manage to enjoy these shows of appreciation. Now that I'm trying to learn to care about myself, it's nice to know that other people care about me too. I've even received birthday messages from people I'm sure hate me, but that was okay too. I'm trying my best to appreciate these things now instead of pushing people away. Okay hopefully I'm done with the personal stuff again. I only decided to mention it because these felt like really important events in my life, and I felt that maybe that should be documented.</p>

<p>Sorry for the late blog post. Just took a second with how much has been on my mind and being sick and stuff. Hopefully I left stuff to talk about next week. See you then!</p>
