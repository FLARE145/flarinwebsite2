<p class="date">10/4/24</p>
<p>I read a lot when I was a kid. I think I can attribute most of my early success to reading. But lately, I haven't been able to sit down and read a book 
</p>
<p>Just a few months ago, I tried to start reading Dune. I couldn't do it. I litterally fell asleep a few pages in. This is not an exaggeration, I was tired that day. But that's not the point. The point is that I was never able to bring myself to keep reading after that. I always wanted to, but there seemingly wasn't time.</p>
<p>If you've kept up with me lately, you'll know I'm in quite a productive mood. I'm using to-do lists, working on my comic (almost) daily, and keeping my gaming to a minimum. Well, in keeping my gaming to a minimum, I figured something out. I think gaming has been stopping me from reading.</p>
<p>Today, I wanted to work on my comic. But I knew the next drawing to do was gonna require a lot of attention, and I only had an hour before I had to get ready for work. So, I decided to skip working on the comic. I didn't want to game either, since I've been avoiding that, and there wasn't much to do around the house. So, I suddenly had an hour of nothing to do. I remembered the book, and I gave it another shot. This time, it was morning, and I was reading with full attention instead of being tired from work. And I read until I was out of time, and I moved on with my day. It felt really nice. I feel confident I can pick it up again soon and continue. </p>
<p>Basically game bad book good the boomers were right. Well it's obviously more complicated than that, but you get the idea. Also I want to clarify it's not like I'm now living a super uptight life with this whole productivity era. After I got home from work today, I took the afternoon off the comic too, and I watched some YouTube with my brother. New TADC episode was today and I couldn't miss it. It's nice to not treat yourself to harshly. Unfortunately, I will also be busy all weekend, so I'll have a lot of ground to cover next week if I want to keep pace with my comic.</p>
<p>That's all for today. I'll update on whether or not I keep reading. This is kinda huge if I can. Maybe this makes you want to try too? Bruahsani</p>
