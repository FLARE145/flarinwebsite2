<p class="date">1/26/22</p>
<p>So progress on everything is going very slow, but at least I posted something to Newgrounds today. I suddenly started drawing this like two days ago and I've put it up today. Check out the <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/art/view/flare145/i-do-not-care-at-this-point" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full artwork</a>.</p>
<p>Whoooo I think that's the first time I've linked something on the blog. Hopefully that link never breaks. In the future I hope to be able to link to the artwork hosted on this site, but at the moment it lacks descriptions and stuff. </p>
<p>So yeah no real blog post today. Your homework is to click the link and look at my art. I put a cool picture on there that shows the development of the drawing so I hope that is something interesting to see.</p>
