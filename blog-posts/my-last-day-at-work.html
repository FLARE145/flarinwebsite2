<p class="date">5/29/25</p>
<p>Today was my final day at my retail job. I worked there for almost three years. Right now, I’m filled with such a unique feeling of relief and sadness. I was so sick of working there, but I’m also so sad to say goodbye to my coworkers. I’ve worked with some of them for a long time, but even people I haven’t known that long have been pleasant to work with. I’m going to miss working there. I’m going to miss the feeling of working there.</p>
<p>I’ve been trying to get a new job for a while now, and something I find interesting is that although I am sad to leave, the point at which I would have been saddest to leave has already passed. I think that within the last year, I began to feel more disconnected with that environment. In the three years I worked there, I worked under five different managers. It almost feels like I worked five different jobs. So instead of this feeling like the end of the massive era of working this job, it feels more like the end of the latest era at that job. My favorite times are long gone, but things are looking up right now too. 
</p>
<p>There are so many vibes I’m gonna miss. There was something cool about having a part-time retail job and thinking about logo commissions I needed to work on after work. It made me feel kind of Peter Parker. I feel like every lunch was a vibe too. Like I always felt that I was meant for more, but I was stuck where I was. Yet, I still enjoyed those moments. I even enjoyed working so hard I felt delirious. The days I will miss the most are the truck days. I’d go to work at 4 in the morning and unload new merchandise. If I had the motivation to move quickly, those days left me really exhausted, but I liked it. I liked the feeling of being there early, working hard, and getting home early. It’s hard to explain. </p>
<p>I have a hard time with managing time for friends, so generally, I only really talk to a few people. That’s why it was really nice that I got along with mostly everyone I worked with. It felt like I had more friends. I’m a little worried now that my new job won’t feel like that, because it will be like I have less friends. I’m okay with that though. It’s just sad to lose contact with these people I came to care about. One of my coworkers even drew me a little Boxkid as goodbye! It’s so cool. I would have included a picture of it here, but it’s a bit late and I’m too tired to set up the picture to post here. I plan to include it in a fanart section on the Boxkid website. I have a couple of pieces of fanart now, so I’ll probably do that soon.
</p>
<p>Without a doubt, I would not be who I am now without this job. The part-time schedule enabled me to grow my art skills in my own time. And all of those projects that I spent my time and energy on are what allowed me to land my new job. So much happened in the time I worked here. Fun Friday, Coaxion stuff, logo commissions, Axo x Minecraft, and Boxkid. I even like looking back at the movies and shows I watched. The job was the ever present backdrop to anything I did, so it does feel weird that it’s gone now.</p>
<p>I’m so excited for my next job. I finally feel like I ended up where I’m supposed to be. Hopefully, that’s the feeling I have when I’m working there. I guess I don’t really know yet. This is also going to be the most I’ve ever worked consistently in terms of hours, so we’ll see how I handle that. Overall though, I’m very very happy. 
</p>
<p>You know what’s crazy though. This blog started before having this job. For some reason that seems crazy to me, but it’s obviously true. You can read me being a little student experimenting with HTML & CSS. It’s a little comforting to know that part of my life is still the same. I’m still FLARE145. I was making stuff before, and I’ll be making stuff after.</p>
<p>Speaking of, what’s next for creative stuff? I’m not sure. It depends on how I handle working this new job. If I get home exhausted everyday, I’m unlikely to have the motivation to do much. I’m trying to stay hopeful that this won’t be the case though. So, probably, I’ll have to put a hold on RSS Plaza. I get the feeling that would require more time and energy at the moment. If I work on anything, it’s more likely to be Boxkid. There’s still a lot of work to do for the next chapter, but I feel that it is more manageable in smaller chunks than RSS Plaza is. But honestly, idk. Axo x Minecraft stays on sleep for now too. And of course, the infamous Rainbow animation is also not a priority. At some point in the future, I’m going to release another set of artwork. At work, I had managers that were okay with me drawing when it got slow, so I ended up with a total of about 100 pages of fun little doodles. I want to post them on my website, but I need to scan them, and then censor any sensitive information like stuff about my jobs location or coworkers names. I don’t know how much of that there is, so I’ll have to check. It’s gonna be awesome when it comes out though. I’m thinking it could be a daily release thing. Some kind of regular release like that would be cool I think.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading. I’ll be nervously waiting to start my new job, and enjoying a feeling of freedom from my old one. I’ll see you later.</p>
