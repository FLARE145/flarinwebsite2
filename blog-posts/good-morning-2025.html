<p class="date">1/2/25</p>
<p>Sorry I haven't made a post since last year guys... lol get it? It's only been about a month but it's the next year now so it sounds like, longer? nvm</p>
<h3>Boxkid Progress</h3>
<p>Yeah it's been pretty slow. I've been busy with work/ Christmas preparation/ Christmas recovery/ New years preparation/ New years recovery/ time with friends. Still, I have gotten 10 pages of the prologue done, which I am quite happy with. My goal is to release Boxkid this month, so I will have to focus a lot more on it in the coming days. </p>
<p>I recently did a read through of Chapter 1 now that it's been a while, and I can definitely say it came out much better than expected. It might not seem like it because of how I talk about Boxkid now, but this was supposed to be my rough project. The one where I don't care if things go wrong or if the story goes down the wrong route. Everything about it was designed around the idea of, "draw forward and anything goes." In writing the first chapter, things got way more defined. Now it's actually pretty cool. There's a balance in my head of how much is an attempt at serious storytelling and how much is random ideas I like. And I like the balance it has right now. I'm very happy with Chapter 1. Very curious to see what others would think too. </p>
<p>Stay tuned. This month maybe. Hopefully.</p>
<h3>2025 Plans</h3>
<p>Eh. I have no idea really. Mostly because I'm supposed to be starting that full-time labor job. I can't guarantee anything, but I hope I'll still be able to make stuff from time to time. I hope to do a second Boxkid chapter before then, which I think is March. And funnily enough, I'd still really love to do more Axo x Minecraft. I never fully got the chance to see that through, and I'm quite sad about it.</p>
<p>I also have not forgotten about my other projects. Namely Rainbow, which I can almost guarantee won't happen this year. If things line up though, it will. I also have to make a game intro for Coaxion before I start the new job, and I have a logo commission to do as well. I'm happy to have a full plate because I know it will be delicious. </p>
<h3>Awesome gift</h3>
<p>Lastly, I wanna shout out my sister who gifted me the coolest thing ever for Christmas. She gave me a long-sleeved FLARE145 branded shirt. She did the logo by hand and it looks sick. I'll try to take a nice picture of me wearing it later, but here it is looking cool in my closet.</p>
