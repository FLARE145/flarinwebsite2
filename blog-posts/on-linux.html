<p>Guys, I'm becoming criiinge. I got linux lol. Well okay so let me explain entirely.</p>
<p>First of all, I obviously don't think that Linux is cringe. There are many cases in which it makes sense to install some version of it. This is one such case. Basically, I've gotten my hands on a fairly old laptop and I installed Lubuntu to give it some extra life. It's been really fun to mess around with honestly. I could totally see myself living on this kind of os, but Windows is still so much easier to work with when it comes to stuff like gaming and peripheral support. For many reasons, I'll be stuck on Windows. Love this laptop though. Fun lil project.</p>
<p>So after all that time with no blog posts, I come back just to say some random stuff about Linux? Yeah</p>
