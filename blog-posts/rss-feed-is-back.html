<p class="date">4/7/25</p>
<p>For a while now, I’ve been wanting to bring back my RSS feed. You might remember that you used to be able to subscribe to my blog this way. I updated it from the post <a href="https://flare145.com/blogpost?=flare145-goes-to-chicago" rel="nopener" target="_blank">FLARE145 goes to Chicago</a> to <a href="http://flare145.com/blogpost?=cool-little-animation-for-coaxion" rel="nopener" target="_blank">Cool little animation for Coaxion</a>, but it was too big of a hassle for something that was unnecessary. Well, in trying to once again improve how I post the blog, I managed to make it much easier for me to maintain an RSS feed. So, if you use a feed reader, be sure to subscribe to my <a href="http://flare145.com/blog-feed.xml" rel="nopener" target="_blank">RSS feed</a>!</p>
<p>I will probably actually support it for a long time now. With the improvements to my system, it’s less work to make a post, even with the added step of the RSS feed. I’ll put a proper link to it somewhere on this page too, because I don’t think I ever had one.</p>
<p>Another reason I wanted to do this is because of my dream of making my own feed reader. I likely won’t get around to doing this ever, but I want to make a feed reader that looks like a little plaza of characters, each one representing a feed. They would be customization so you can make them look like your friends sona or something, and have them walk around with that friend’s feed. I just think it would be cool, but it’s probably impossible for me to ever make.</p>
<p>I’ve got some stuff to do so I’ll sign off for now. Did you notice I’ve been making more posts? I’ve been in a writing mood lately. Not sure how long this will last for, but I do at least have one more post I’ve been typing out for a bit. Not sure what day I’ll post it, but probably soon. Until then, see ya</p>
