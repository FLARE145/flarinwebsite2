<p class="date">12/2/24</p>
<p>Okay I've been avoiding talking about Boxkid here because it's the only thing I'm working on and I was getting tired of that being my only topic. Now that it's been a while though, I have plenty to address. </p>
<p>First, chapter 1 is complete, but not yet releasing. Anyone following the Boxkid account on Bluesky will already be aware of this. The plan is to make an additional chapter (a prologue) to release with chapter 1. This was never the plan originally, but after writing the first chapter, a lot more of the overarching story became clear to me, and the prologue is there to round out the feeling of the beginning, and better explain the setting to people who aren't me.</p>
<p>The comic is no longer going to have a scroll version like originally planned. I might make it eventually still, but I realized that making that doesn't align with my goals at the moment. The main reason I wanted to do that was to upload it to webtoon and tapas. I figured that would increase the discoverability of the comic, at the cost of my artistic intent. Well, since I started making Boxkid, Newgrounds came out with features for uploading comics. And in page form. So, because the popularity of the comic isn't a concern, I'd rather just put the page version on Newgrounds and completely drop the other two. It makes things easier for me too, because it's really hard to translate my work intended for one format to a different one.</p>
<p>For a bit of cooler news, I've also finished an official Logo for Boxkid. This was something I kind of wanted to avoid initially because not everything needs a logo, but I had an idea so I went with it. I knew from the get go that I had to take a much different approach from my normal logos. I make a lot of logos, enough that I've gotten to do a few paid gigs now. I really wanted this to feel not like that. A big mantra for Boxkid was, "this story isn't written from the start." This was actually supposed to be a major theme for the series, until I accidentally came up with a bunch of the story. I'm probably getting rid of that as a major theme, but part of that is still forever part of Boxkid. When illustrating the first comic, I started without a plan, and illustrated forward, keeping whatever I happened to draw. About half-way through I ran into something I wanted to cut, which is was finally broke that rule. After that, I did plan out the chapter and went through with drawing it all. My point is, a lot of Boxkid is built on spontaneity, so although I had an idea for what the logo might look like if I made it through my normal methods, I realized I absolutely had to take a more authentic approach. So, I drew it and photographed it, like most of the comic itself. I'm really happy with the final result, as I feel it captures the feeling of spontaneity and somber that is my intent with the comic's style.</p>

<p>So what now? I'm currently still working on the prologue. I'm 7 pages into a planned 16. The style is entirely different, and I hope the effect of that makes the style of the main comic more impactful as a whole. </p>
<p>I'm really excited to get this out there. As I've mentioned before, this comic is so much more for me than anyone else. This is a project that will fall out of priority from time to time, but I think that over the course of my life, I might be able to finish it. I hope everyone that would enjoy it finds it someday.</p>
<p>That's all for now, see you later</p>
