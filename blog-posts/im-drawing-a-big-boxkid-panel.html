<p>Last week I was finally able to start working on Boxkid again. I can't say it's gone smoothly though. I finished writing the first draft of chapter 2 which is a huge deal, but drawing hasn't been as efficient as I want it to be.</p>
<p>I get a maximum of 2 hours a day to work on stuff like this, and I made good use of that time while I was working on my recent logo commissions. This last week however, I've been more exhausted after work, so I'm only getting 1 hour of work in every day. I really hope I'm able to find more energy this week, because drawing this first page of the chapter is going to be rough. It's a 15" x 15" drawing with probably more detail than any previous drawing in Boxkid. I keep telling myself that the goal isn't perfection, because otherwise it's too overwhelming to work on. I hope the end result looks cool though. I think the rest of the chapter doesn't ever do anything that ambitious, so that will progress faster. All in all, I am excited to be working on it again.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is another hurdle to working on the comic. We're doing a pumpkin decorating contest at my job, and I want to put a lot of effort into that because I think it's fun. I only have about 10 days now to work on that, so it looks like I might have to hold off on Boxkid again while I do this. I think it's worth it though because I have a cool idea. I'll show it here when I'm done. Hopefully it comes out how I want it.</p>
<p>That's all for now. See ya</p>
