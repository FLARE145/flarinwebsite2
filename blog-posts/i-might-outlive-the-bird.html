<p>A few things to talk about in this post. First, Spore! The second part of my Spore playthrough has been released and you can watch it on <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkPSKMxyvPA" rel="noopener" target="_blank">youtube</a> right now! Okay next</p>
<p>I've actually finished the achievement icons for real this time. The page for it will exist eventually. The projects page is still a work in progress, although the page for my toy story animation does technically exist. I've been quite busy so work on that is going kind of slow, but there's not much of a reason to rush at least. Unless of course, it was the only place to find my stuff???</p>
<p>I say that because Twitter is currently going through some insane restructuring that might end up killing the platform forever. This is why having your own website is cool :) although I do be relying on servers that aren't my own. But yeah, twitter is one of my smaller followings so I wouldn't really care if it died. I've got the Newgrounds for the real ones and my website for the ultra real ones. Long live FLARE145.com!</p>
<p>In terms of what's coming up, I can't really guarantee much. Hopefully I can draw a few more things before the end of the year because that's all I can expect from myself. Oh and Spore part three of course. But as always, I'll make plans known on the blog first. See you later internet folk</p>
