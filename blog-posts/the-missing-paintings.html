<p class="date">2/20/25</p>
<p>The other day, I saw something that reminded me of a painting I had made a few years ago. I pulled out my phone and checked my art page on here because I thought it would be there, but it wasn't.</p>
<p>It turns out, there are actually a few paintings I never put on this website. I think it's because by the time I was photographing them, I had already traded those ones away. I think I might still have some photos I took with a phone, so if I find those, I'll add them. </p>
<p>This has also got me thinking about my massive doodle archive. I have a lot of old drawings that could go on here. Some of them are probably too personal or lame, but I think I'll put the cool ones here someday. Also I need to start making a project page for Boxkid now that it's officially started.</p>
<p>I'm starting to relax on the current projects a bit so maybe more blog posts about random stuff in the coming days. That's all for now though. later</p>
