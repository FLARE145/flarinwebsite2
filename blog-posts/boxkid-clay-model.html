<p>I made a Boxkid clay model! I don't really know why. Well I know why. I was feeling bummed out and needed something to distract myself. I think I made this last week? Don't remember. Doesn't really matter. Is cool</p>

<p>I used some like, oil based clay? The one that doesn't dry. So I destroyed it because it wasn't actually cool enough to justify keeping it around. I'll prob make a digital model at some point to help me draw some panels down the line.</p>
<p>Speaking of, my progress on drawing the first chapter has slowed significantly. At least it doesn't matter too much since Boxkid isn't important. One of the reasons I've slowed down is that I've been putting more effort into making a website for CoaXioN. It's going smooth enough, but my brain feels filled to the brim with janky javascript code now. Portions of my brain are split between the different complex systems I've made for each of my websites. Blog posts are handled one way here, chapters of BK are handled a different way, and the blog posts for CoaXioN will also require a new system. It's hard not to get all of the different methods for stuff mixed up. Oh well. It's probably good for me to stress my brain a bit.</p>
<p>But yeah, I'm up to drawing page 6 of Boxkid. Am pretty happy with it but I know most people will not get it or will not care. But that's fine. Boxkid doesn't really get it or care either. In fact, I care so little that I'm not even going to finish thi</p>
