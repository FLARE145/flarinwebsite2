<p>The Spore video is finally up! Wow I've been using a lot of exclamation marks lately. I guess I'm just happy??? Idk. Anyways, the video is just part one of three. The og streams happened in like January, which was actually a pretty wild time for me. I made a lot of mistakes around that time, and I'm still dealing with the aftermath of that. It's nice to see something good come from that time, so releasing this video actually makes me really happy. Thanks to MTD again for continuing to edit the stream highlights. Who knows how long they would take if it were entirely up to me. But yeah heres the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmbYnbWy9wU" rel="noopener" target="_blank">video</a> if you want to watch it.</p>
<p>Oh actually this is a good place for me to post the thumbnail art for this. I wanted to go for a more painted style for these videos, rather than my standard cartoony look. I'm really proud of this one, so I might even put it on Newgrounds idk.</p>

<p>Thanks for watching or reading or whatever. I'll be back tomorrow to discuss my thoughts on the Mario movie trailer. See you then.</p>
