<p class="date">10/25/24</p>
<p>Although I'm still in quite a productive mood, I have slowed considerably recently. I don't think it will be an issue though. This next week is properly set up for me to get back up to speed on things, so I don't feel that bad about having taken a mini-break.</p>
<h3>I LOVE READING</h3>
<p>A new thing that occupies my free time is reading. I think that I mentioned trying to read Dune in the last post, and I'm happy to say that I've been able to stick with it. It is very enjoyable actually. I've finished what I believe is the first third of the book, and I think it's already more enjoyable than the movie version. I miss being a book guy, and I'm looking forward to becoming that again. It feels like it keeps my mind awake.</p>
<h3>Dark Winds</h3>
<p>Dark Winds is a tv series that my sister recommended I watch, and I can confirm that it was a good recommendation. It takes place in the 70's on the Navajo Nation and plays out as a mystery-solving thriller. The first season is probably one of the most satisfying seasons of tv I've ever seen. The second season is not as tight, but it was still fun to see more of it. If you're willing to commit some time, I'd recommend watching the first two episodes. I think you'd be able to judge if the show is for you or not based on that. </p>
<h3>Gaming</h3>
<p>While I was previously very strict on no gaming, I've dipped back into it again as a way to connect with friends. Specifically I've been playing Crab Champions and Webfishing. I've spoken about the crab before, but Webfishing is new and it's really nice. It's the perfect game for just hanging out and talking, which is maybe my favorite type of game. It is a little bit concerning how much I've been playing, soley because Boxkid work requires that I do things on pc, and being on pc is what tends to lead me to game. I think I just need to shut myself off of games strictly for a week and I should be good. </p>
<p>I've been thinking lately that I might want to shut off completely from the internet at some point. Not forever, but for like a week as an experiment. Not sure I can commit to that, but I'm very curious to see how it would affect me. I think if I tried it, it would be whenever I start illustrating for Boxkid chapter 2. </p>
<h3>Job Interview</h3>
<p>For whatever reason, having something like a job interview scheduled takes up a lot of my mental energy. Like, just knowing that it's something I have to do within the week makes me slower to do other things I'd like to do. It's not like I was nervous or anything, it's just a bad habit of mine to need a clean week to do anything. I'm working on improving that about myself. Anyways, I didn't get the job which is fine because I bassically didn't want that job. I'm sure they could tell by the end of the interview, but it was a nice experience and one of the better interviews I've had in a while.</p>
<p>This reminds me of another boring real people thing I had to do recently which was getting my health inssurance set up again. It's stuff like this that takes my attention away from working on my own things, and leaves me too exhausted to do anything other than relax. Like I said earlier though, this next week seems like a good week for me to focus on my comic.</p>
<h3>Watchy</h3>
<p>Lastly, I bought a watch. How is this taking up my time? It's open source, and I've been messing with switching out the watch faces. It's quite a complicated process, but I have been getting it to work. I want to experiment with making my own watch face, which is likely to involve bro ball to some degree. I really like the watch as a whole, and I'm considering making a short video about it.</p>
<br>
<p>That's about everything in terms of what's happened since my last post. Actually I just remembered I left out the whole bluesky thing. Maybe I'll talk about that more soon. Anyways, see yall later</p>
