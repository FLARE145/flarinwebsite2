<p class="date">1/2/26</p>
<p>Yesterday I watched the 2-hour finale to Stranger Things, ending a series that I've been watching since 2016. It's been significant enough to me that I want to dedicate a post to it.</p>
<p>When I first saw Stranger Things, it was because my sister was watching it, and she introduced it to me as some kind of hidden gem. At least that's how I remember it. From that perspective, I thought it was fantastic. I believe I was in 7th grade at the time, which lined up with how old the younger half of the cast was in the show. I basically grew up in sync with the Stranger Things characters, even though now, I am 4 years older than them in the finale. Anyways, there's something about that first season that was really cozy. That feeling was understandably lost as the scope of the story grew bigger with each season, but I still find myself looking at the series from my original perspective. As some kind of hidden gem.</p>
<p>It's honestly a pretty fantastic show. It didn't take long for me to realize this show was actually a massive success, but I didn't let that mainstream attention change how I viewed it. Thankfully, that mainstream attention is what lead to the show having a ridiculously high budget moving forward, and I'm so so glad that it did. It probably has the best vfx of any tv show I've ever seen. That's not to say it's always impressive compared to a movie, but usually it is. I can't think of other tv shows that have been able to afford such quality practical effects and digital effects. Costume design and set design are the other big highlights. Regardless of what anyone thinks of the show, it will be remembered as a big accomplishment.</p>
<p>Story-wise, I was always interested. Everyone describes the beginning of the show as ET/The Goonies, but it's awesome that the show grows in scope to become almost cosmic horror. The writers have said that the premise was inspired by the popular conspiracy theory known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montauk_Project" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Montauk Project</a>, and that inspiration really shows. "Government experiments on kidnapped children that result in them having powers," is a phrase that could describe both of these stories. The connections go a lot deeper, and the differences are fun to identify. For example, the original conspiracy deals heavily with sending the children through time after a failed invisibility experiment lead to the discovery of time travel, while in Stranger Things, that same experiment lead to the discovery of another world. I also think it's cool that the whole show integrates aspects of other parallel conspiracy theory's , such as a believable depiction of the satanic panic and hidden powers in popular music. It's a cool plot in an interesting setting involving lovable characters. The writing is pretty consistently good, and only really bad if it's not interesting to you. It can be a bit "quippy" but I'm the kind of person that likes that.</p>
<p>There was always a lot of time in between seasons, so I never felt too attached to the show. The episodes also always released in batches instead of weekly, adding to that effect. And I'm grateful for that honestly because if I really got attached to this, the ending really would have hurt me. It is a good ending and a satisfying one. One that acknowledges everything the characters have gone through in a way that feels like it transcends the show itself, and is a goodbye to the audience. Even with my low attachment to the show, I went to sleep last night with that post show depression. I'm fine now but wow, for anyone that really cared about this, the end of the journey is really going to hit them.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed the finale to the show, and in retrospect, I really enjoyed the entire show in general. I rarely had critiques of it any time new episodes dropped. It's definitely something I'm going to re-watch later on, but it isn't quite on the level of my favorite things of all time. I have a very high respect for the show though, and I'm glad it got to have a satisfying end. I'm glad anytime a show doesn't get needlessly drawn out. The final product that is the entire show is great.</p>
<p>Again, it's not one of my favorite things ever, which is why I felt the need to dedicate this whole post to it. I will probably never mention it ever again, so this is my public appreciation of it for all time.</p>
<p>In other media news, I'm gonna watch Avatar 3 soon and I can't quite remember what happened in either of the previous movies. I can't wait to enjoy and then mysteriously memory hole this new movie lol. See ya</p>
