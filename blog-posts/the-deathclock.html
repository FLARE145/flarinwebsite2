<p>If I don't land some sort of art job before next year, I will be working full-time in a labor job. I am fine with this and I'm actually pretty certain I'll be happy. Still, I feel that clock ticking. When my time runs out, I won't be able to dedicate myself to my work as often.</p>
<p>Reflecting on this past year, I've wasted a lot of time. I have plenty ideas that I'd love to bring to life, but I've spent to much of my time taking it easy. Well, it's more complicated than that. I have to take things easy to some degree. That's what I do to stay alive. But, I really should dedicate myself more to what I want to do. And I haven't been doing that for a while. I think I just feel obligated to serve people, and I don't treat myself in a way that is respectful to myself. Lately, serving people has meant being there for them. It's hard to push against that. The feeling that if you weren't there, things would be worse. The feeling that my actions can make someone's life worse. And knowing that the actions I want to take, directly compete with the happiness of others.</p>
<p>I think I'd like to stop acting that way. I want to stop seeing things from that perspective. I want to do what I want to do. I haven't felt that in a long time, but now that I feel it, I can't just let it go. So, how has this manifested itself?</p>
<h3>Boxkid Progress!</h3>
<p>I think I've worked more on boxkid during this past week than I have in the past 4 months. Well, at least in terms of actually writing and drawing. I spent that time in between thinking about the story and world. I've left a lot to figure out still, but I know enough to write this first chapter. I'm so excited. I've drawn at least one panel for the past few days. It's feeling rewarding. I want to dedicate a lot of my time to this now.</p>
<h3>The rest</h3>
<p>Axo is on hiatus. I still actually do want to make more of those, but they are for fun and not important. Rainbow, my child, will have to wait. I think that's everything. Oh, coaxion stuff. Idk it will happen when it happens. I'm likely to still help on things but for now, full steam on boxkid.</p>
<p>Random cool thing is that I'm uploading a video soon. Maybe today. It's just a video of this weird glitch I got on an emulator, but it's funny so look out for that. Anyways that's all. I'll see y'all later</p>
