<h2>Insanely Productive Day</h2>
<p class="date">8/31/23</p>
<p>So lately, a lot of my free time has been going into gaming. Other than gaming though, I've been working on the CoaXion website. Still a lot to do but progress is chugging along. Something interesting happened today though.</p>
<p>I was trying to set up for potentially working on more DMCR achievement icons soon. I realized some of my files were still stuck on my old computer hard drive, so I had to go find and retrieve the files from there. While I was in there though, I figured I'd grab a few more files I hadn't had the time to transfer before. I ended up transferring the files for some old animation projects. Specifically Tankforce and Club Penguin Dance. Because I now had access to these again, I figured I'd make proper project pages for them. So that's what I did.</p>
<p>I didn't proof-read them at all, and I'm probably forgetting a lot of cool behind the scenes information, but the pages should be live now. I'll update them later on if I have to. I also finished another tiny animation for Dial-Up Studios today. I'll probably post about that again soon.</p>
<p>Yesterday there was a blue super moon, and I managed to take decent pictures of it. I put them together into like, one hdr picture. If I have time tomorrow, I might make it into a fun friday video. So yeah, really trippy how much I've done today. And seemingly out of nowhere too. </p>
<p>And finally to update on Boxkid: it's still goin. Slower this week because I worked on some extra stuff as mentioned above. I'm realizing that I might have to launch it next year if I don't speed up my process. Good thing I have no deadline or anything.</p>
<p>That's all for today. Gonna go game now probably bye</p>
