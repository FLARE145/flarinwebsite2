<p class="date">5/9/25</p>
<p>Many months ago, I made reference to the <a href="https://flare145.com/blogpost?=the-deathclock" rel="nopener" target="_blank">deathclock</a>. I was referring to my intention to work a labor job by April of this year, if I wasn't able to land any other job. The last few months, I've been mentally preparing for this. I still kept applying to other jobs, but I had essentially accepted that that my life was going to feel over.</p>
<p>It's May now. I interviewed for that road work job, and didn't get a call back. This wasn't an issue with qualification or anything, they just had limited spots and I didn't apply early enough. So, for a few weeks, things felt odd. The clock made it to the end, but my life didn't end. Then, last week, things got interesting.</p>
<p>I got a call from an employer looking to schedule an interview with me. A sign shop. It's the kind of place I've been wanting to work at. I didn't think much would come from this as I didn't have much luck in the past, but I was still going to put my best foot forward and see what comes of it. And, what came of it was probably the most successful interview I've experienced.</p>
<p>We talked back and forth about design, art philosophy, and the role of the business. I left feeling like I had made a great impression, but they still hadn't made a decision. I was later asked to complete a short design task as a sort of test, so I saw that as a good sign. Then, just yesterday, I was offered a job! It's interesting because while I had applied for the role of designer, circumstances led them to offer me a different role. It's a bit hard to explain, but I will be assisting the shop in places that they need more assistance in. It's more about being responsible for a wide set of tasks, instead of just a design focus. Obviously I took the job, and I'm super excited to work this role in particular. It sounds very interesting, and I hope it's fulfilling. It will definitely be an upgrade from my current job, although I will have to get used to working more and having more responsibility, both of which I feel completely capable of. I might just be a little more tired for a while.</p>
<p>So with this, the deathclock is defeated. I landed a job doing something that I want to be doing. It's incredible. I've been trying not to get too personal in my blog as of late, but this is very personal to me. It's a personal victory. And with this victory, this entire blog has now become an interesting story. It's a record of some of my ups and downs, and a record of my journey into a variety of interests. It's not entertaining, but it is interesting. To me. The guy that it's about. idk</p>
<p>So what's next for FLARE145? A lot, lot less. I'm gonna be much more busy, and I'm going to have less energy to work on my passion projects. That said, maybe I'll get used to it, and I can pick up work on these things again later on. I fully intend to keep working on Boxkid at some point, and right now, I'm going to keep working on RSS Plaza while I can. But once I start this job, I want to prioritize doing a good job there. You might be seeing a lot less of me, but FLARE145 is unkillable. I can't stop making things. So trust me, you'll see me around.</p>
<p>Updates on other stuff: not that much. Aside from working more hours at my current job, I've mostly been freakishly focused on RSS Plaza. It's going very smoothly right now, which makes it addicting to work on. I'll probably make another post on that soon. Or maybe I'll just keep posting about it on Bluesky because of the convenience. </p>
<p>That's all for now. Thanks for reading and following my journey. This is the beginning of new things in my life. I'm happy. See you later</p>
