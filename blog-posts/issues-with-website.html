<p class="date">9/17/21</p>
<p>I've realized that at some point, it would be inefficient of me to keep the whole blog on one page. I have to come up with some improved system, whether it be multiple pages, individual pages for each post, or loading functionality. I don't know when I will have the time to restructure this, but I think I can at least make a "back to top" button that will make things nicer for now.</p>
<p>Also since I'm already talking about the website, the search rankings have tanked really bad. Its been bad for a while so I don't think it will ever go back up. I just wish I understood why it moved down so much. I know that its ultimately an unimportant issue, but it bugs me. At least I have conquered the rankings of every other commonly used search engine.</p>
<p>I love how one of the most common topics on here is the website itself. This is some enticing reading.</p>
