<p class="date">9/30/21</p>
<p>I haven't paid any attention to my Youtube channel since I went all in with Newgrounds, but I looked at it recently and I realize how poorly managed it is. I don't really care for success on Youtube, but it would be nice if the videos at least looked interesting. I know for a fact that I would never click on most of the videos because of the clunky titles.</p>
<p>For example, I would never click on "Club Penguin Schmooves and Schemes (Twitch Highlights EP.5)" but I would click on "I joined a gang in Club Penguin"</p>
<p>I know I wont do it for every video but the majority will be renamed. Not right now though because I don't feel like it.</p>
