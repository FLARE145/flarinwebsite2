<p class="date">10/3/23</p>
<p>I recently dedicated a good chunk of time to working on the <a href="https://coaxion.games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CoaXion Website</a>. It's still lacking info on the individual projects being worked on by the group, but the base for that stuff has been set. I'm not sure how much more time will be needed to finalize everything, but I will probably make another post about it when it happens because I'm actually really proud of that website. It's not a good website from an accessibility perspective, but in terms of vibe, I did pretty much exactly what I was asked to. I think the biggest sacrifices I made to the original vision are just stuff that would have made the mobile experience worse. I was really stubborn about mobile usability despite the heavy use of javascript. The final result is definitely something interesting, so maybe check it out by clicking that link way at the top of this paragraph.</p>
<p>Now I get to talk about other stuff hehe. Uhhh okay so Boxkid progress has slowed to a crawl. This is mostly because of the website stuff, but I'm back at it starting today. I've decided to keep drawing until I reach a satisfying ending for this first chapter, so it might still be a long time before I officially launch it. I've been feeling fairly nervous about it lately because I've realized that people are actually going to see this. Like, when I draw it, it's kind of just for me? It's like my really complicated way of venting. There's something frighteningly personal about it, so to expose that to the world is scary. Especially when the general presentation is something that looks half-completed on purpose. I'm worried that it will come across as something really lazy that has no heart, when really, it's something kind of lazy with potentially some heart. Idk. I'll just have to see how it goes.</p>
<p>Screw it I'm doing a long post today. Another thing about Boxkid is that I really want to show it to people I know who aren't aware of my online shenanigans. I think I've mentioned this a lot recently, but it's still something that makes me nervous. I think I want to introduce more people to my stuff soon, but it really is a painfully embarrassing situation. Sometimes I forget how weird it is that I do all of this random stuff that I care about, and then never tell people about it. I guess its because I don't think anything I make is that good, so it's embarrassing to say that I care about the stuff I make. It also feels grossly narcissistic to tell people to look at my internet stuff, but that's just because I'm already narcissistic in general, so I don't need more of that.</p>
<p>Okay weird rant over. Next blog post when I feel like. Thank you for reading this if you made it this far. You have earned nothing except for that strange and unnecessary thank you. Hope you're happy and goodbye</p>
