<p class="date">10/5/25</p>
<p>It's been a couple months now since I've really had the chance to work on my own projects. I was working on RSS Plaza when I got busy with some commission work, but as of yesterday, I'm finally done working on that! For now at least.</p>
<p>That's right now I finally have the chance to work on not RSS Plaza! Although that's the main thing I want to do right now, I'm gonna focus on making another chapter of Boxkid. It's getting closer to a year since the last one, and I hope to be able to make them more often than that. I have no idea how long it's gonna take for me to finish another one, but I'd like to get that out before returning to RSS Plaza. RSS Plaza is definitely going to take a long time, so I'll take breaks from that project to work on addition Boxkid chapters. Otherwise, I'll be working on other commission obligations whenever they return to haunt me.</p>
<p>Speaking of haunting, it's October! I really like this time of year. Favorite kind of weather. </p>
<p>That's all for today. Stay tuned to see how work on Boxkid goes. I'll see ya later</p>
