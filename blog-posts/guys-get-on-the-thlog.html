<p class="date">7/11/25</p>
<p>Okay first, lemme explain why I'm late like a week to making the post I said I would. After coming back from camping, I've been really busy. Mostly it's just me being tired from work, but also I had some errands pile up so I basically haven't done anything interesting on my own time for the past week. My mini social media break did go well though, and I'm likely to try something similar again, maybe this time without youtube as well.</p>
<p>Okay but now for what really matters. The thlog is real. My friend Tholp just updated their <a href="https://tholps.site/" rel="nopener" target="_blank">website</a> so go check it out! It's got aura and a blog.</p>
<p>Oh also I just remembered another reason I didn't post was that I kinda messed up my method for making posts on my phone. I haven't been on the pc much lately but when I tried to post from my phone, I didn't bother fixing it. So yeah, hopefully I fix that soon because it's more convenient for when I'm tired.</p>
<p>Speaking of, I'm way too tired rn. see ya later</p>
