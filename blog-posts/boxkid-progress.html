<p class="date">7/26/23</p>
<p>I haven't been working on Boxkid at full force, and I don't think I ever will. There's gonna be long wait times in between chapters. This is just so I don't waste all of my time doing one thing. I've also been working on other stuff like finishing the Coaxion logo (it looks awesome) and making a Coaxion website too. Well I haven't technically started on the website but I will. Oh I also streamed again too, so that was fun. I beat Half-Life 2 episode 1 in a single livestream. This means I just have to play episode 2 and then I'll be mostly caught up with Half-Life. Oh wow oh no this is a long and unstructured paragraph. Lets just end it bruh</p>
<p>Okay fresh paragraph for me to ruin. Let's get back to Boxkid. I spent a lot of time recently just establishing standards and formats for myself. Really small stuff like panel line width and trying to figure out how I want to letter the comic. I wanted to figure this stuff out first so that there can be some consistency in the comic. So yeah, kind of got the hang of that and now I think I have established a production pipeline for this project. I'm currently done drawing 4 pages of the comic, and 3 of those are completely ready. I'm hoping that I can end this first chapter in 30 pages, so according to that, I'm a tenth of the way done.</p>

<p>I'll update this soon with more Boxkid news. I want to see if I can produce at a faster rate now that I have my process down. See you next update!</p>
