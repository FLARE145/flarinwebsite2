<h2>Cool little animation for Coaxion</h2>
<p class="date">11/13/23</p>
<p>So with the mini cool-urls arc out of the way, let's get back to my actual creative output. </p>
<p>Boxkid has been on a bit of a hold. I know that's super lame but I swear I'll get back to it. Probably today actually because I think I have time. The thing happened where I suddenly wanted it to be good so I got creatively paralyzed. I have to turn back my level of caring just a little bit in order to get back to work on it. I know that's probably a weird concept to understand but it's just how I work idk. Still excited for it to come out and still not sure when it will.</p>
<p>What most of my efforts has gone to lately has been a small animation for Coaxion. It wasn't something I was asked to do, but rather something I wanted to do for some reason. Idk I just had an idea and I wanted to make it. Here's my initial idea:</p>

<p>My idea was a short 3d animation where this sign in the middle of an ocean paints the Coaxion logo onto itself. Here's a look at my favorite test render so far:</p>

<p>I've been really happy working on this just because I haven't messed with blender in a good while. I don't know when I will finish it since I might take a break to work on Boxkid again. It's looking pretty cool though and I just wanted to share my progress.</p>
<p>Quick extra bit of house keeping: I'm no longer going to support the rss feed. It's too much work for what it's worth. I'm also deleting the old version of individual blog post pages to replace it with the newer one I made a while back. I might miss a few links so some old links might break, but it shouldn't be that big of a deal. Just trying to clean up a bit.</p>
<p>The year is starting to come to a close and while I'm not entirely happy with what I've managed to accomplish this year, I am happy that I allow myself a lot of time for these small projects. Now I just need to find out how to make money and survive and stuff. Maybe next year tho lol</p>
