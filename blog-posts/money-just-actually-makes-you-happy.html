<p class="date">7/26/25</p>
<p>For a long time now I’ve tried to refrain from talking too much about how I’m doing internally, mostly because it would have made reading this blog really unpleasant. I prefer talking about my creative projects, but lately, I haven’t had much time to focus on that stuff. So, Even though I already gave a personal update with my posts about my new job, I thought I’d make yet another personal update where I talk about my new job.</p>
<p>Basically, I’m actually just a happy person now. It’s not like I’m making a ton of money, but I feel financially secure enough to not worry too much about upping my income immediately, so my free time is actually spent not worrying about the future. I kind of thought financial security wouldn’t bring me this happiness because most of my unhappiness comes from depression, but I’ve been getting better at handling that over the past few years. I’m finally at a healthy point mentally, and that happened to line up with the added financial security. The new job is also just generally rewarding in a way that makes me feel like I’ve achieved some form of self-actualization. I kind of attributed my depression to random stupid brain chemical stuff because my more serious episodes occurred seemingly at random, but I realize now that some of it was probably informed by my low self worth. My self worth is finally in the green so to say, and it’s definitely making a difference.</p>
<p>I guess a big part of this for me is that I derive fulfillment from making things. I find my job fulfilling because I get to make cool signs. Actually I found my old retail job fulfilling too, it just wasn’t going to make me a living. </p>
<p>In animated movies, for some reason there’s this trend of the protagonist finding fulfillment in one movie, and then suddenly they neeed a romantic partner in the second movie to feel happy at all. Well, I’m happy to confirm this doesn’t happen in real life. At least not with me. I actually don’t think I’m suited for romantic relationships at all, because my happiness and fulfillment come from things that are counter to relationships. I’m an artist, and I love making art, but people forget that making art is very very lonely. I don’t mind it. In fact, I often think about a world where I don’t have any social relationships at all. I think I would do fine, but in the end, I still like having a few friends. Its fun, and fun isn’t something I want to entirely strip out of my life. Anyways, I was mostly bringing this relationship stuff because I guess I expected that to be the next thing I want out of life, but it’s really not. I think about it a bit, but I think mostly it would just get in the way of the rest of what I do. </p>
<p>So yeah, moral of the story is that happiness is possible. Even if you are antisocial, unemotional, or otherwise a idiot. Find your fulfilling actions, learn the ebb and flow of your low points, and find security in your future. That wasn’t very many words but it represents a lot of hard work, so it really isn’t easy or simple. But it is achievable. I hope this maybe makes feel someone feel inspired or something idk. A lot of this comes down to stuff outside your own control, but I guess the best you can do is try and be prepared for when things could be in your control.</p>
<p>That’s all for now. See ya later</p>
