<p class="date">1/6/26</p>
<p>This Sunday I watched the third blue people avatar movie, Avatar: Fire and Ash. I guess this is a review but also I just want to talk about the whole series.</p>
<p>I remember seeing the first Avatar movie on a tiny crt at my (uncle?)'s house in Spanish. I probably didn't even see the whole thing as I wasn't actively watching it, but my point is that the movie was so huge that literally anyone was watching it. I saw more glimpses of it over the years, and I definitely always thought it was cool. Sometimes it felt like I was misremembering the movie though. Like I remembered it looking like a real world, even though I knew it wasn't. But none of the movies I saw growing up came close to that feeling, so I assumed it was just my child brain exaggerating my memory of it.</p>
<p>I thought it was really funny when James Cameron started talking about making 5 of these. I kind of thought that wasn't real, but 2022 brought the second movie, Avatar: Way of the Water. My family and I realized we all had a real interest in seeing it, so in preparation, we re watched the first movie. And wow, that movie actually looks like that. My child brain did not fail me, we really just had near perfect cg in 2009.</p>
<p>It is dated, but really impressive. Compared to any random Marvel movie, the effects are just better. The movie itself can be considered a <em>tech demo movie</em>, and I love tech demos. I don't think I've ever seen the first movie in 3d, but this movie was always the go to for people who cared about that. </p>
<p>The plot is mediocre, but the movie doesn't suffer from that too much. Every aspect of the setting is simple, but it works as a whole when you add them all together. It's fun to watch a movie that's so blatant with everything it shows you. I think that's what made it appealing globally. You see the bad army guys and you know they're bad army guys. You see the main dude sad in the wheelchair and you're like, yeah, he definitely likes his blue guy life more. Everything is very straight-forward but it's executed with maximum aura. Avatar is a fun movie.</p>
<p>I had no idea what they would do for a follow-up, but I was instantly sold after watching the second movie. Way of the Water kind of has to re-hash a lot of elements from the first movie to work, but everything new is fantastic. The world expands so much. New interesting characters are added. The main protag and villain have even more aura now. And the visuals are even better. I saw it in 3d and it was peakness. Very beautiful. I definitely think you kind of have to see these movies in 3d or in a large theater because the immersion is really part of the experience. I jokingly told my brother the other day that he should watch all the movies on the 3ds in 3d and I think he's actually gonna do it which is funny. If I re watch them, it will probably be on a Steam Frame. Anyways yeah. 2 is better. Better visuals. More aura. Oh yeah it's significantly longer as well which I think is nice because the pacing feels good.</p>
<p>The third movie is great and I think I'm gonna have to be it's defender, but where 2 borrowed some elements from 1, 3 is practically the same movie as 2 for some parts. It's really odd, specifically, the ending is super similar. I learned afterwards that 2 and 3 were originally written as one movie and that makes a lot of sense. Anyways, there's still a bunch of cool new stuff that happens. I really like where they took the different plot threads, and I'm ready to show up again when the next one comes out. Some people say you have to be the right kind of person to really like these movies. I have identified myself as this kind of person. These movies are like 2ft deep but awesome. </p>
<p>That's all I got really. Now that I think about it, I kind of feel like I said nothing at all but clearly I did write something because this post has like a bunch of text in it. Consider this a genius analogy for how the actual events of the Avatar movies seem to fade away instantly after watching as if what you had just experienced was merely a dream. This is true and very weird. I'm getting better at remembering the character names after 3 movies though, so some of it is starting to stick.</p>
