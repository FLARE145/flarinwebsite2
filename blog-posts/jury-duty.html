<p class="date">1/10/24</p>
<p>I got summoned for jury duty. Really didn't want to go but thankfully my current situation is really flexible so it wasn't going to be to much of a hassle to deal with.</p>
<p>Anyways I bring this up because it was a MURDER TRIAL. I kept telling people that I hoped it would be interesting and they said it for sure wouldn't. My experience ended up being so wildly entertaining to me that it doesn't even feel quite real. I won't talk about it here because I think it would read boring in text, but I'll definitely mention some stuff on a stream at some point. This stuff happened yesterday by the way. I didn't get selected for the jury and got excused, but I really wouldn't have minded being there. Literally just made this post so that I can say that I was almost a juror on a murder case.</p>
<p>So yeah. Fun little episode for me at the beginning of the 2024 season. I hope the rest of this season is good.</p>
