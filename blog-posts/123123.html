<p>Yo look at the date. It's 12/31/23 so it looks like 123123. Kindsa funny yeah?</p>
<p>Today is the last day of the year. Overall, I had a decent year. Don't have the clearest path to an actual career in anything though, which was sort of a personal goal of mine. Better luck next year I guess. In terms of online creative stuffs, I'm pretty happy. I wrote all those articles about my animations like I wanted to. I did a season of Fun Friday, although didn't manage to make one every week unfortunately. </p>
<p>Okay, so here are the FLARE145 plans for 2024. Animations! Might be like only 2 but still. That's cool. I can almost guarantee that Rainbow will come out this year. I say almost because it's already been like 2 years since I started that project lol. Generally though, I'm moving away from the FF format in order to make better stuff hopefully. I want to be making animations that I can use to land myself an actual job instead of strange videos that are fun but usually only for me.</p>
<p>Aside from that, Boxkid Vs. The Ocean should begin it's run. At this pace, We probably looking at a chapter per year, but if I can dedicate more time to it, I think it's reasonable to get two more chapters in. This one is purely a passion project though so that's why I'm not too concerned about making it quickly.</p>
<p>I have no sense for how much livestreaming I will be doing. Probably going to happen about as often as it currently does. I have cool ideas for stuff but it probably wont happen on account of me trying to get an actual job.</p>
<p>That's about it for the year. Thanks for tuning in to the Fun Friday era, and I hope you enjoy this new era. See you guys next year!</p>
