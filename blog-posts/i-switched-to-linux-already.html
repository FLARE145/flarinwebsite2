<p class="date">5/28/25</p>
<p>Okay so last week when I said I was considering switching to Linux, I kind of thought I would do it later in the year. Turns out I had the motivation and interest to do it now, so I installed openSUSE Tumbleweed on my desktop computer about 5 days ago. It’s a dual-boot setup so I can easily launch Windows 10 on a separate drive. I thought I'd talk a bit about my experience so far, but be warned. This is probably going to be a boring post. Also I don't actually know what I'm doing so I'm probably going to say stuff that is incorrect in this. Just ignore. Thank you.</p>
<h3>Installing graphics card drivers</h3>
<p>The first hurdle I encountered was installing Nvidia’s proprietary driver for my graphics card. I tried various methods suggested online, but it took until maybe the fourth hour of my efforts to find one random Reddit comment that solved my issue. No idea how I would’ve fixed it without that comment.</p>
<p>Despite it being such a hassle, the feeling I got when it finally worked was incredible. I can’t really describe it. Usually when you do something like this, you’re glad that you finally don’t have to deal with it anymore. In this case, it was that same feeling but additionally, I felt like I had learned something.</p>
<p>Installing video and audio codecs after this was super easy, and I ran into little trouble.</p>
<h3>Audacity</h3>
<p>Okay so this is a short story that makes no sense. I installed Audacity through the package manager Zypper. It didn’t work. I uninstalled and tried again. Didn’t work. I uninstalled and tried with Flatpak. Didn’t work. I uninstalled. I slept the computer and didn’t come back until a few hours later. I logged in, and Audacity was open. I did the quick audio edit I installed it for, and then closed the program. Tried to open again, and it didn’t exist because I had already uninstalled it before. Installed through Zypper again, and now it works with no issue.</p>
<p>No idea.</p>
<h3>Installing Mullvad VPN</h3>
<p>Mullvad provides a Linux release in the form of a .deb for Ubuntu/Debian and a .rpm for Fedora. openSUSE also uses .rpm, but there are issues with doing that when it’s not intended for openSUSE. In this case, the distributions have packages that are named differently, so the proper way to install this is to edit the .rpm and rename the dependencies it lists. I followed a guide on how to do this exactly, but the tool I was using, rpmrebuild, would fail when trying to create the modified rpm. Again, skip a few hours of trial and error, and I found a Reddit comment mentioning issues with the specific version of rpmrebuild Zypper installs. I tried a different version, and everything worked.</p>
<p>I don’t know how I would do anything without the random obscure Reddit comments out there.</p>
<h3>Installing Huion Tablet Driver</h3>
<p>It’s important to me as an artist that my pen tablet works correctly on my computer. I was avoiding setting this up, because I was afraid that this could be the thing that doesn’t work. Well, it turned out to be surprisingly easy. Huion only provides a .dep, but it turns out there’s a tool called alien that can convert this to an rpm. I did that, and the rpm installed with minimal issues. Everything works now!</p>
<h3>LogiOps</h3>
<p>My mouse is an MX Master 3s from Logitech, and I really love it. On Windows, I set a button to use gestures for different screenshot actions. I wanted to replicate this on my new install, and sure enough, this software called LogiOps exists. You can essentially configure all the same stuff you could with Logitech’s software on Windows, but now it feels less bloat-y. There’s no ui or anything, you just have to edit a configuration file. I think I did run into some issue to solve for this one too, but honestly I don’t remember anymore. It works now. On Windows, I was using ShareX for screenshots. On here, I’m using Spectacle. I got it to behave the same way as before, so I’m pretty happy with it</p>
<h3>Gaming on Linux</h3>
<p>I installed Steam and played a bit of Warframe running with Proton. Worked great! I played some I installed Prism Launcher to play Minecraft and it worked great as well. I haven’t really tried more games yet, but hopefully everything is fine. There was one small issue with these games though, and that was fullscreen. Warframe had buggy behavior after tabbing out of the game on fullscreen that I could only fix by restarting the game. Minecraft would straight up crash when I toggled fullscreen, and it would also crash when I quit the game. I have figured out what the issue was though.</p>
<h3>Nvidia doesn’t work well with Wayland</h3>
<p>In addition to those games, I was also having issues with OBS. Trying to open a windowed preview or fullscreen preview would crash the program. I switched my window manager from Wayland to X11, and the issues disappeared. OBS stopped crashing, Minecraft stopped crashing, and Warframe no longer had any issues. I’ve been told Wayland is generally better, but it has issues with Nvidia graphics cards. It’s a shame because I kind of do feel like X11 has some quirks too, but at least nothing is broken anymore.</p>
<p>I guess its true that if you are building a PC with Linux in mind, you have to go AMD.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>My experience so far on Linux has been a lot of fun. If you are a “project person,” you’ll be happy to find that doing anything on here could be a project. I really just need Affinity software to run natively on here, and then I genuinely wouldn’t use Windows again. Except for multiplayer games I guess. Idk I’m seriously considering quitting Fortnite because of the effort to boot Windows now. The experience has been pretty good so far though, especially because I already used a lot of open source software (Krita, Blender, Inkscape, OBS, LibreOffice). I definitely don’t recommend openSUSE to anyone who isn’t already a tinkerer. If you are curious about computers, like solving puzzles, and aren’t easily frustrated, openSUSE is awesome. Otherwise, Mint is probably fine I think. That’s all for today though. See ya later</p>
