<p class="date">5/20/25</p>
<p>The biggest thing that differentiates me today from the me of last year is my focus. I feel as though for the past year, my focus has been steadily coming back to me.</p>
<p>This probably began with starting to read again. I attribute all of my early mental development to how much I read books as a kid. After I stopped going to school, I mostly stopped reading. Maybe that contributed a lot to brain fog I experienced afterwards. Well, maybe brain fog is the wrong term. I was definitely less focused and less motivated, but anything I worked on with passion was easy to work on. </p>
<p>Last September, I had an interview for a job that didn’t go so well, and it motivated me a lot to get things better next time around. I think it was that energy that carried me through working on Boxkid, and then starting to read. But reading really compounded my energy and improved my mind. I was just reading Dune, a fiction novel, but it helped with activating more of my brain. Since then, my breaks have been fewer and shorter. I’ve  pretty much always been working on something, and then sometimes I loosen up to talk with friends.</p>
<p>Currently, I’m really focused on my RSS Plaza project. It’s going well, although my pace has slowed down in the past week. I’m in the middle of working my last two weeks at my current job, so some of my free days have been spent doing a couple odd things I wanted to get done before starting the new job. Namely, getting some more clothes because my work wardrobe was not prepared for a 5 day work week.</p>
<p>Maybe my new job is creating some kind of pressure in my mind that helps me focus on my project. Kind of like a mini version of the previously mentioned death clock, but I know that this job will obliterate my time entirely. I think this project is just interesting enough for me to stay glued to it.</p>
<p>Working on RSS Plaza has been addicting. I’ve realized that it’s the culmination of so many things that I’ve learned over the years. I started learning HTML and CSS in 2020, and created my personal website in 2021. I didn’t see myself as a programmer, as I spent the previous years making animations in Blender. I understood how coding works, but I just hadn’t invested time into it, and didn’t see myself beginning to. So, I avoided JavaScript at first. Eventually, I learned JavaScript little by little for small features on my website. This grew until I ended up making more websites with more JavaScript. I’ve still never felt like much of a programmer until this project. After 4 years of tinkering, I’ve gained the ability to open the documentation for a JavaScript library and start building a project with relative ease. Three.js has proven to be incredibly addictive to work with, as it doesn’t take much effort at all to start rendering models and animations I create in Blender. Now, not only can I make cool stuff to look at in Blender, but I can bring them to life in on my phone in a web browser. Where Boxkid is a sort of a personal snapshot of my love for simply drawing on paper, RSS Plaza is the culmination of whats possible with the more technical skills I’ve acquired over the years.</p>
<p>For a post about focus, I think this came out very unfocused. That’s all for now. Maybe next time I’ll talk about uhh… idk. See ya later</p>
