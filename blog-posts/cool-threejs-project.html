<p class="date">4/29/25</p>
<p>So lately, I’ve been working on a new code project. I know this takes time away from some of my other projects, but I just have too much energy for this to ignore it.</p>
<p>I’ve brought this up before, but the idea is RSS Plaza. Basically, it’s an RSS feed that has a presentation inspired by Nintendo console apps like Streetpass Mii Plaza. You will be able to assign a feed to a robot character, and click on the character to see the latest post. The robots will be customization with two colors and a profile icon for their face.</p>

<p>This started happening because I suddenly started teaching myself three.js, and I immediately saw how I could make this old idea possible. I’m very happy with how it’s looking so far, I just need to be able to put in the proper functionality. I’m a little worried on that front, but my brother said he can offer coding help when it comes to actually dealing with the feed stuff, so the focus right now is getting the characters to work how I want.</p>
<p>There’s a chance I might be getting a new job soon, and in that case, I won’t really have time to work on this. I wanted to make a post about this with these screenshots before then, but who knows. I might still be able to make this happen. I really hope so at least.</p>
