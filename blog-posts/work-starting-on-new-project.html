<p>I'm still poop busy with school stuff, but plans for my next animation are in motion. I'm going to be making a fake trailer for a short film I wanted to make a while back.</p>

<p>I hope I can do this idea justice. It was originally cancelled because I couldn't come up with a satisfying conclusion to the story, but that wont be necessary for this fake trailer. The idea never went further than my sketches.</p>
<p>Other random thing of note, the current Newgrounds banner has my Pico model on it. It features several models from the newgrounds 3d discord. Pretty cool.</p>
