<p class="date">4/10/25</p>
<p>Have I talked about this before? This is one of those things I could talk about forever, so maybe I will discuss this in greater detail later.</p>
<p>I work on a wide variety of creative projects, and it’s a difficult thing to balance sometimes. There’s so much I want to make, but also so much I’d like to experience.  In science, <em>activation energy</em> is the amount of energy required to start a chemical process. I like to use this term to refer to everyday tasks, including creative projects.</p>
<p>A task with low activation energy is something like washing dishes. Yeah it can be time consuming if there’s a lot, but its really easy to get started. Just need a sponge and some soap. A task with high activation energy might be something like fixing a car. There are so many more variables, and there’s a possibility that this task balloons into multiples steps. Most importantly, it requires more thinking.</p>
<p>In my mind, my hierarchy of which projects to work on is pretty clear. Commissions, Boxkid, other projects, and leisure. However, I don’t distribute my time according to this order. It’s more like commissions, leisure, other projects, Boxkid. So what’s happening? I’m acting according to activation energy, prioritizing tasks that are easier to start.</p>
<p>What sucks about this is that I’ve observed this about my life for a long time, and I came up with Boxkid to combat this. It was a project significantly less interesting than other stuff I wanted to make, but I started working on it to invest into something that was designed to have low activation energy. Of course, my most reasonable fears came true— I ballooned the scope of the idea. It’s okay, because I feel like I came up with cool stuff. The problem is that “cool stuff” requires so much more thinking. And planning. Planning sucks. </p>
<p>Something that helps with these tougher tasks is to have more time in the day to actually get started, but that happens less on days I work. This is the main reason I haven’t worked on Boxkid much for over a week. I’m not likely to work on it much for the coming days either, but I am going to try to dedicate some time today to a little bit of planning. I want to make proper model sheets for my main characters, and now that I’ve lifted the traditional paper only restriction on myself for planning material, this should be easier to make than what I originally expected. So I’m pretty excited.</p>
<p>I’ve been having fun writing more posts lately, but I might be slowing back down now. I want to write out some more long ones, but they are going to take a while. There are two long posts I’d like to make in particular. In one, I’d like to discuss my current stance on ai generated imagery and the future of the visual arts. I’ve been wanting to make a video on this, but my attempts at that have not gone well, so I think the post will have to do. For the second, I’ve been meaning to collect my ideas on the presence of hypersexuality on the internet. There’s a lot to discuss with this one, so it’s probably going to take me a while. I just remembered that there’s also another one I started to write about vibe-coding. That will probably show up within a week. </p>
<p>That’s all for now, see ya later but less frequently!</p>
