<p>I meant to make a bunch of blogposts about stuff, including this one, but I forgot because I've been playing a bunch of fortnite.</p>
<p>It's actually kind of really bad for me. It started like 2 months ago when I got asked to play fortnite because of the og season. I played and it was fun. I slowly got more and more into it and then the new season came out with a bunch of new modes. I was suprised at how good the rhythm game is. I'm addicted to it and it is a massive time waster. I'm behind on Boxkid, Fun Friday, and Christmas shopping because of it. It fun tho</p>
<p>gonna go play more fortnite bye</p>
