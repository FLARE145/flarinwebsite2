<p class="date">6/5/24</p>
<p>I haven't made a post in a while, but this isn't about that. This is about my bicycle.</p>
<p>From 2017 - 2021, I rode a bicycle to and from school. Every morning I got up early to go to school, and every afternoon after running cross country, I rode back home. I went everywhere with it. I remember buying chocolate from the store. I remember riding in my hidden spots. In 2020, I went on a 24 mile ride just for the hell of it. And in the years following 2021, I still rode to work sometimes. But not as many adventures anymore.</p>
<p>My uncle had inherited the bike from my grandfather, but he had no use for it. He gave it to my dad, who let me use it. And I used it so much that it became my bike. If you couldn't tell, I am very fond of the bike. Which is why letting go of it is such a big deal to me.</p>
<p>Despite all the repairs and replacements, it's age is showing. I've felt that I've outgrown a bike with the issues that it has. Or maybe I just feel it's time to move on. I could keep fixing this one. It's a good bike. But I'd like to move on. So, I let my parents sell it.</p>

<p>I will miss it. It's just an object but it means so much to me. More than anyone could know. It's hard to explain. But I'm happy to sell it. The bike has much more life left in it, and I wouldn't want that to go to waste.</p>
<p>Goodbye friend. I enjoyed every adventure.</p>
