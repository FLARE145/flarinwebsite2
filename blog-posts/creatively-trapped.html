<p class="date">4/3/23</p>
<p>I've felt pretty sad about my creative out put this year. I really only have time to be making the weekly fun friday videos. They're fun, but I don't think the end result is really worth it. I find myself thinking about stopping the series, or at least making it like a monthly thing or something. I really want to work on my animation but I can't justify that use of time when I have my weekly video to work on. Idk. Just feel kind of stuck.</p>
<p>I still draw here and there while at work. My coworkers like my drawings so they keep them displayed, but eventually I'll try to take pictures of them to post here. There just small doodles but its been one of my bigger creative outlets I guess. </p>
<p>Other than that stuff though, I've been enjoying life quite a bit. I've got a good balance going and I'm hopeful in my ability to get a job in IT eventually. I just don't want that to kill this side of me. I'm happy there's no real pressure for me to create stuff though. That's probably why I'll always come back to it when I can.</p>
<p>There's been some interesting ideas I've had in the past for stuff, stuff like Speed Render. I'm realizing I might never get to make those projects a reality, so I might start talking about them on here. Idk. Maybe I'll just do this whole year of fun friday and spend next year's free time on a completely different project. I think I'd be willing to do that.</p>
<p>Well, hopefully I'm back soon. Bye!</p>
