<p>So this page is going to become my official blog. This website is still very much a work in progress, but its been a fun little thing to work on. This is the grand sequel to my old google sites page which I made back when I was like 11.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what I'll do exactly with this page. It's mostly here as an homage to the news page on the original website, but It might be fun to post wip stuff from my projects. Not many people will actually see this, so I can probably talk about spoiler-ish stuff related to whatever I'm currently working on. So yeah. Come back once a year or something to see what I've been up too. It might be more interesting than the kind of stuff I put on twitter.</p>
