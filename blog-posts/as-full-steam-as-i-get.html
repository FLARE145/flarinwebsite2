<p class="date">9/30/24</p>
<p>I'm putting a lot of my energy towards the Boxkid comic, so this is going to be my mega progress update for now. Afterwards, I'll try to mention it less until I have more actual interesting updates on it.</p>
<p>Okay so how is it going? It's going really well actually. Over the last two weeks, I've drawn 3 new pages and edited 5 into finished pages. So basically about 30% of the finished pages were only finished in the last two weeks. That's kinda crazy. I hope to keep the pace, but I worry I won't be able to. We'll see.</p>
<p>Assuming that I can keep pace, my prediction for a release date is next May. I'm guessing that between a chapter 1, 2, and prologue, I would have about 55 pages total by the time I feel comfortable publishing. Assuming I can complete two pages a week, that's 27 weeks of full effort. I might be able to finish before that full-time job I'm supposed to get. So yeah, it's a little sad, but who knows. I might change plans and just release at chapter 1. Or I might drop the idea of a prologue. Or I might be able to draw a lot more at some point. Idk. Safest bet is to add and entire year to my guess.</p>
<p>Either way, working on it makes me absurdly happy. I just like doing it. I could make the whole comic just for myself and be happy. But I know it will be even more fun to release it. I can't wait. There is a couple things I worry about though. I really don't think anyone is going to 'get it.' Like, I think people will either interpret it as deeper than it is, or not deep enough. My lil comic isn't really supposed to be anything that crazy, but I feel you do need to be some level of literate to understand it. Oh well, none of that is super important anyway. </p>
<p>The box will be real soon is what matters. Yeah. Uh I thought I had more to say but I guess that's it. See ya later</p>
