<p class="date">7/3/25</p>
<p>I've been taking a break from my biggest distractions (bluesky and discord) and it's been going very well. I got some decent work done on my commission work and I finished watching the new squid games (it was good?). I initially intended to write more updates here, but when I was on the computer, I really was only working.</p>
<p>Anyways, there actually is a reason I'm forcing myself to write this update though. I totally forgot that I'm going camping this weekend for 4th of July. I'm driving there today after work, so when Saturday comes, I might still be absent. It depends on whether or not I get signal there. </p>
<p>That's all I have the time to write at the moment. If I get signal where I'm camping, I might write a more detailed blog post about how my break went. See you then hopefully</p>
