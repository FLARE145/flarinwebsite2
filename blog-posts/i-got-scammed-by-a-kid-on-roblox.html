<p>I would call this a new low point but that would be a disservice to my life. Also it really wasn't that bad.</p>
<p>Basically, I was looking for a new Roblox game to play during class, and I started playing one where you try to survive in a crime infested city. You can work as a floor scrubber to make some money, but the stores in the city only sell stuff like clothes and food instead of weapons. To get weapons, you have to negotiate with other players. I was offered a knife in exchange for 50 in-game Euro. I gave the guy the money and he left. No knife. I got played on roblox.</p>
<p>I forgot everything else I was going to talk about. My shameful story is all that I can think of right now.</p>
