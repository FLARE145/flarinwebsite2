<p>That's right, I'm finally done with the first two chapters of Boxkid. It's feels like it's been such a long time, and it has been. I came up with this idea in June of 2023. Since then, most of the work has been me not actually working on it. But once I got around to actually doing it instead of thinking, it still took a while. And then the idea for the prologue happened and yeah. Kept ballooning, but here we are now.</p>
<p>I meant to post way more updates, but I guess that sort of thing gets in the way. Especially with how so much gets scraped and reworked. I don't want people to see stuff that won't be in the final product, and it's hard to judge what that might be while I'm in the middle of making something. Maybe I'll post cool stuff afterwards? Like a couple of interesting behind the scenes posts might be cool. </p>
<p>Today has been a long day of getting everything set up for the release in 3 days. I'm surprised at how much I've been able to get done actually. I think that after tomorrow, everything should be super duper officially ready. Everything on the website and Newgrounds will be prepared for the drop at 9am PST. </p>
<p>Not much else to say for now as I am very tired. I hope my efforts can entertain someone. And I hope also to prove that anyone can make anything. See ya later.</p>
