<p class="date">4/4/25</p>
<p>The title of this post is mostly in reference to the lack of posts lately. I mentioned last time that I was going to be making more frequent posts, and I don’t really know why? I guess I wanted to try talking about actual topics instead of what I’ve been up to, but I forgor. So here’s what I’ve been up to.</p>
<h3>Coaxion Game Intro</h3>
<p>I pretty much finished the Coaxion game intro. It’s still not done because the audio is not final. I did not work on any of the sounds or music, that is being done by Rahim and Hellbie from Coaxion. I am supposed to send some audio of me mimicking what I would like it to sound like, but after that, I’m done.</p>
<p>The history of the intro is kind of crazy actually. It started a long time ago when MTD had an idea for what the game intro would be like. I think I’d describe the idea as late 2000’s tv motion graphics with a more modern flat look. I don’t remember the sequence of events, but at some point, I had my own idea for an intro that I thought was so good that I volunteered to just make it, separate from the intro I had been tasked with creating. I did think it would make a good game intro specifically, but I went into it knowing that it could never be used. This became what would be known as the Black Ocean Intro.</p>
<p>I’m really proud of the Black Ocean Intro. My goal with it was to make something I thought would be more visually interesting and with more character. I think I achieved this well, but the intro was not in line with what was originally intended for the game intro. It was decided this would be used in contexts outside of games like development videos and live streams. Again, I’m not certain about the timeline on this, but I believe I got to work on my second attempt after finishing Black Ocean.</p>
<p>This version of the intro was heavily based on the original mock up I was provided. I matched it beat for beat, but still changed the visual style a little bit as the original just wasn’t clicking with me. I felt it didn’t match my understanding of the direction of the already existing Coaxion visuals. The main logo is a modern flat logo that is interrupted by a messy gritty look. As someone who loves simple designs, I was still always more drawn to the messier side of the branding. Overall, the goal was to evoke almost a nostalgic feeling for recent but older depictions of the future. Not retro-futurism, but like, yesterday-futurism. I felt that the 3d graphics aspect of this time should be more strongly represented, so I depicted some of the mock up’s flat elements as 3d ones. In the end, I think what I came up with looks okay, but it certainly suffered by my confusion at the mock up’s direction.</p>
<p>I considered the project done (it only needed music) but before it got finalized, the tone of the original mock up finally clicked with me. I remember there was a very particular thing I saw that made it clear to me. I wish I could remember what it was. Some movie or artwork, or maybe even a video game. I quickly made a concept image of what was a flat motion graphic screen like the orginal mock up, but with a lot of changes to how things are placed. I’d say the biggest difference is the color scheme, which is a reoccurring problem with the stuff I make for Coaxion. Value structure is important in making something look good, but the instructions for Coaxion elements has always been to stay in the gray range. I’ll admit that my lack of understanding of low contrast compositions got in the way of making these branding elements, but it did lead to cool things (like black ocean and the current look of the website). On top of those changes, I had one more risky idea to spice up the into.</p>
<p>I always wanted to make a Coaxion mascot. I don’t know why. It’s very unnecessary, but I always had cool ideas for it. Black Ocean was originally going to feature a robotic shark, who was originally an idea for a mascot. Having a mascot never made sense though, and it still doesn’t. The robot shark was removed not only because we decided on not having a mascot, but also because it would have been a technical challenge. It would have required me to rethink a more complicated way to display the ocean, because I would have needed to do some kind of fluid simulation to have it appear as I would want. If this wasn’t a problem, I might have kept it, almost like a mascot for that specific intro. What ended up happening is very interesting though. The signpost sort of became the mascot for that intro. From the reactions I’ve heard toward this intro, people tend to personify the sign a lot, which I realize now is a huge success. It lead me to thinking one thing: people get attached to “little guys.” </p>
<p>I was sad that the game intro was not going to have any kind of “little guy” for a player to get attracted too. I felt it was important to at least try to recreate something similar in the new intro. So, I revisited the concept of the mascot. If it wasn’t going to be the shark, what would it be?</p>
<p>I’m realizing that this is getting very long, so I’ll save some details for the projects page whenever I make that. It will probably have most of this info plus more like pictures and videos. I’d rather wait until people can see the intro before really showing the visuals, so you’re just going to have to believe me when I say that I think the mascot I came up with is good. I’d like to mention that this also might not be <em>the</em> mascot for Coaxion, but rather a mascot, similar to the sign. I would never call the sign a mascot, but it is a character that exists in the presentation of Coaxion, and that’s the same so far with this new mascot. I would like for the new one to show up more, but that’s yet to be determined.</p>
<p>So, to clarify, the new intro now has an extra 3d animated scene featuring this new mascot, and it’s awesome. I called this a risky decision earlier because I thought it might have to be cut for time or because it didn’t match the tone, but we were able to make all of that work out. The end result is almost like a two part intro that makes use of cool 3d animation and clean 2d motion graphics. I like this a lot as it echos what I was saying earlier about the main logo. This all probably sounds insane without actually seeing it, but trust me, it’s really cool. It’s only about 12 seconds as well which is shorter than Black Ocean and the original mock up I was working off of. </p>
<p>ps: I realize now that I already included a picture of the mascot I'm talking about in the last post. Basically, it looks like that model in the screenshot, but metalic chrome. It's a simple design inspired by those cut-out paperdolls that hold hands.</p>
<p>Wow sorry that was a lot for just a random blog post. Again, I’ll probably re-word all of this in the future for a project page. That will have a clarified timeline and visuals and stuff. And the finished thing. I mostly went on this ramble because it feels like the conclusion of this whole journey. Anyone reading this who hasn’t seen it should expect to see it when Lambda Fortress releases. </p>
<h3>Keyboard</h3>
<p>Notice how I typed a lot in the last section? Well I accidentally like typing now. Basically, I built myself a nice keyboard finally. I’d show a picture but I feel like I’d need to put a lot of effort into taking a nice one, so maybe I’ll save it for another day. I’ve been training my typing skills, so this is probably the best I’ve ever been able to type ever. I also now use LibreOffice Writer to help with writing Boxkid, so I’m using that right now to type this. I’ll then copy it into my blog tool to post. I did it this way because I felt I had a lot to say, and wow, I really did. Glad I did this instead of risking losing all my writing by accidentally refreshing the page or something (has happened before).</p>
<h3>Boxkid</h3>
<p>With the Coaxion intro mostly done, I have returned to working on Boxkid. I am writing chapter 2 in a much different way than I wrote 1. My thought process before was to be very “I’ll come up with it as I go” because that is in line with my vision of the project as a whole. I realized half-way through that especially for the first chapter, this was not the best idea. I planned out the rest of the chapter before drawing it, and then finished one my favorite things I’ve made. Maybe. I am happy with how it turned out I mean.</p>
<p>For this chapter, I am introducing a few more steps to my process. My first draft is a rough written script, defining what the general plot of the chapter is and including some dialogue. The second step is a rough outline of the pages themselves. Every panel is planned with a super rough composition and more specific dialogue is introduced. Essentially, I should have little trouble in just following this outline when doing the final illustration process, which, is the third step. I will probably edit the final illustrations onto the page as I’m drawing them, so the fourth step of editing the pages kind of happens at the same time. </p>
<p>I am also looking into creating (or maybe commissioning) better reference material for myself to keep character designs or locations consistent. Not sure on that yet though. Either way, I have no sense for how long this chapter will take to make, but I hope to have an update on my prediction soon.</p>
<h3>Work</h3>
<p>This doesn’t really matter but I have been working a lot recently. It is the main thing that is slowing me down from making progress on Boxkid, so I just wanted to mention that. I have the next few days off though, so I’m really looking forward to that. (I wrote this maybe two days ago and yeah, it's been super nice. Mostly keeping up with the new Nintendo news which is fun for me.)</p>
<h3>Dune</h3>
<p>Oh hey I finished reading Dune! It was very good actually. That’s the first book I’ve finished reading for fun in a long time, and I’d like to do that more. Even though it was my intention to start reading it over a year ago, I'd say I didn't really start until around October. I probably wouldn't recommend it to everyone, as I what I find enjoyable to read probably differs from a lot of people. The juice in this book comes from internal dialogue that I think many might find boring, but if you like <em>thinking about society</em>, this is a very entertaining cautionary tale with some really cool world building. Will probably read the second book at some point, but I’m in no rush.</p>
<h3>Pomni</h3>
<p>Oh hey, I actually drew something again! Recently I drew Pomni from The Amazing Digital Circus. I'm a pretty big fan of the series so I wanted to make at least one piece of fan art at some point. I'll embed the photo here but you can also check out the <a href="https://flare145.com/artwork/di007" rel="nopener" target="_blank">artwork page</a> for more details.</p>

<p>That’s pretty much all for now. Thanks for reading! I do feel like I have more to say, but I gotta stop promising more frequent posts. We'll see what happens. See ya later</p>
