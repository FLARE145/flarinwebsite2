<p class="date">3/31/22</p>
<p>I know I said I was gonna stream a lot this week, but I kinda just been enjoying myself so... yeah we'll see how the rest of the week goes.</p>
<p>More stuff about Speed Render. I'm working on some stuff for that still and progress is slowing down a bit. I think I should have my prompt list soon though. It's going to be a list of 13 prompts, giving my first season 13 episodes. The theme music still sounds like trash but I might just leave it alone for now. I can make it better for season 2. Other than that, I'm still figuring out how I'm gonna do the one hour timer but that should be easy. I also showed off a funny background I made for myself to use during those streams. I showed a glimpse of it during my last stream but I'm gonna tweak it more.</p>
<p>Speaking of that background, today I've decided that I'm going to make a cg recreation of my room. It's going to be mostly for fun, but it should allow for some weird stream stuff too. Like I'd be able to render my room in different lighting. Maybe even render a long sequence where my room gets darker over the course of the stream. I just think there's it opens up some fun possibilities. My streams are becoming less and less real. I wonder how far I can push it... </p>
<p>Oh yeah the sequel to The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild got delayed. It's kind of a shame because I was really looking forward to it, although I am happy that I don't have to spend the money on it right now. The first game is honestly one of my favorite games of all time. Maybe I'll talk about why that is someday.</p>
<p>I'm probably gonna be talking more about Speed Render as I keep getting closer to the premiere. I think I'll make as much of a ruckus as I can when it starts, so it shouldn't be hard to miss. See you next update post.</p>
