<p class="date">3/2/24</p>
<p>I kinda forgot to make a post yesterday again so I guess weekly post will be Friday or Saturday. Sorry, it was my intention to be really specific about blog post dates but whatever. This is the best I can do I guess.</p>
<p>Anyways, I forget yesterday because I went to go watch Dune part 2. It was good. I just watched the first one this week and I really liked that one. They are movies that feel good to watch. Like the cinematography is just kinda good. I watch a lot of less serious stuff usually so it is really nice to see what competent film-making looks like. Anyways, I'm gonna try to read the books now so hopefully that goes well. I haven't actually read a book because I wanted to in like a year, so I hope I enjoy it.</p>
<p>Haven't been on too much creative work lately because I been gamin. Minecraft mostly. I intend to get some drawings out soon though. I've been working on some drawings along-side Boxkid so I don't get too tired of one project. I think it's been working out well. No update on job search but we going long game on this.</p>
<p>That's it for now. I'm gonna force myself to draw rn and be productive. See ya!</p>
