<p class="date">3/22/24</p>
<p>Been having a nice March. Probably better than the last few I've had</p>
<p>I don't think I have much to talk about this time around. I didn't work on Boxkid this week because I had more hours at my job this week. I worked on Axo Plays Minecraft but there isn't much to show for it at the moment. So like, creatively I just don't have anything to talk about.</p>
<p>I get the feeling I'll have more to talk about later. Just not a whole lot goin on right now. Just chillin. See you later!</p>
