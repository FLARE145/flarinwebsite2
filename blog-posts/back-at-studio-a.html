<p class="date">7/18/23</p>
<p>In my head, I like to think of my room as studio A. Just for fun. And wherever I physically am is studio B. Anyways ignore this thought, let's just get to the news.</p>
<p>So yeah, I'm back from Chicago. Was awesome and I can't wait to go again. Now that I'm back home, I have more tools available to me to finish that Coaxion logo. I think I'll probably stream that later today. If not soon.</p>
<p>Now onto some more interesting stuff. The blog now has an official rss feed! If you don't know what that is, I wouldn't be surprised. It's actually pretty annoying to explain to people so I won't try to right now. You can look it up if you are curious. If you know what rss means than this is cool, but if you don't, it's not something you should worry about. The link for the rss feed isn't public on the website yet, so I'll drop a link here so you can access it early if you'd like. You can follow <a href="http://flare145.com/blog-feed.xml" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my rss feed</a> on your preferred feed reader.</p>
<p>Along with this update, individual blog posts now have unique urls. You might remember that I <a href="http://flare145.com/blogpost?=what-no-creative-outlet-does-to-a-mf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">tried to do this before</a>, but my new method is better. I mainly did this so that the rss feed can link to it's corresponding blog post. Oh and if you're wondering why I'm suddenly going all in on this rss stuff, it's so that I can make an rss feed for Boxkid. So every time a new chapter releases, you would see the update if you follow the rss feed. I'm thinking of more ways to make sure people can easily hear of a new chapter release. Prob just do a twitter account or something. Maybe email list? I think that might cost me some money so no.</p>
<p>Uhhhhh yeah no more updates for today I think. I'll start drawing actual pages of boxkid soon so stay tuned for that.</p>
