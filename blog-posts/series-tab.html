<p class="date">1/16/24</p>
<p>Today I made a change to the art page that I've been meaning to make for a while. </p>
<p>I <a href="https://flare145.com/blogpost?=projects-page-is-live" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mentioned it before</a> but I finally added a series tab to the art page. This page lets you sort through collections of pieces I grouped together. My goal is to upload a bunch more art to my website. I'll be including more stuff like small doodles in it's own collection. Now that I think about it, it should be called the collection tab. I like series though because it is a shorter word.</p>
<p>Before I do that though, I plan to move all of the full art images to a different hosting platform. I'm going to need more space if I add more stuff, so I hope to get this sorted out soon. In particular, I'm really excited to upload my entire series of work doodles. I doodle a lot at work and it would be really cool to include that here. I'm thinking I might release them weekly and make them exclusive to the website. I'll talk about it more when I get around to that.</p>
<p>That's about it for today. Now I gotta check if I broke anything or not</p>
