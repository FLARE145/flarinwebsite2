<h2>RIP El Boi</h2>
<p class="date">2/23/23</p>
<p>Hello people, I'm writing this from a <em>new</em> computer. I say <em>new</em> in <em>italics</em> because I've been upgrading this same computer for years now. It's a Lenovo H30-05 from 2013, but since this latest upgrade, it has been officially "ship of Theseus"ed. What I mean is that no part of my computer is an original part anymore. I've essentially built a whole computer. </p>
<p>I've been using this new setup for about a week now and it's been really nice. The temptation to game more is far greater now that my stuff actually loads. HDD to SSD makes a huge difference. Also bruh I was streaming with chrome tabs and gaming on just 8gb of ddr3 ram. Things should run better next stream. Won't look any different though.</p>
<p>Uh no updates on other stuff I think. Mostly just forced myself to write this because I was reminded it exists. I'll try to post something from my post backlog soon</p>
