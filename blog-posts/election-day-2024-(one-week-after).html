<p class="date">11/12/24</p>
<p>I finally got to participate in my first U.S. presidential election this year. It was an interesting feeling. My county was always going to be red and my state was always going to be blue, so it definitely felt like I had no impact on anything. At least I know that I personally was not responsible for electing that embarrassment of an American. </p>
<p>I will be okay all things considered. I am a man. I am a legal citizen. I am cis. But there are so many people who's lives are suddenly in danger. People I'm related to. People I know. Good people. And even people outside of the country. Maybe especially so. My life will be fine, but I can't ignore that what has happened is detrimental for everyone.</p>
<p>I think to many people, it will seem like I am ignoring this. Recently, I've become a much more positive person, and this has made my life much better. I'm not letting this situation set my character back. So for reference, if it ever seems like I am avoiding talking about political stuff, it's because I am. It's because there are times to discuss, and times to live a life. At some point, there is only so much you can do to make a difference. I'd rather focus on the battles I can win. The ones I fight everyday when I talk to strangers in my town. The ones I fight with kindness and empathy. And there are times to stand up and make specific points and arguments that are divisive. But that can't be all the time. Not for me at least. I feel that I make the largest difference by interacting with people in my immediate proximity. I show them that someone like me, with my beliefs, is a kind and good person. </p>
<p>If anyone happens to be reading this and you think I am not doing enough, please tell me what to do. Tell me how to help. Because I genuinely do not know what else I can do to be more impactful. </p>
<p>I live in a highly transphobic and misogynistic population. I cannot treat these people like they are less than me. They are not. They have lived their lives this way for longer than I've been alive. I know there is an urgency. People will have their human rights infringed upon. But these people will not listen if you yell. I'm trying my best. I have conversations with strangers when I'm at work, and sometimes, I do believe that I've helped people make progress. There are people in there. Most of them. I encourage anyone reading to do the same if possible. I understand that if you are one of these people whose lives are in danger, you cannot treat the people who want you dead with compassion. To you, I ask nothing except that you take care of yourself. To those who can't handle these people, keep yourself away and safe. But to everyone else like me, people with nothing to lose, fight the urge to hate. Find a common ground, and have productive conversations. It's hard, and a lot of people suck, but it's the best option we've got.</p>
<p>I don't think I've ever talked politics here, and I didn't even get very specific today. I think I'd rather never get more specific than this post. This blog is not the place for that. Anyways, thanks for reading. More normal posts soon. </p>
