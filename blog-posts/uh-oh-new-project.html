<p class="date">6/7/23</p>
<p>Okay so I actually be kinda popping off at life rn. There's a few different commission-y things I'm working on and it's been fun. Unfortunately, I also be doin a tiny bit of work on some other personal stuff that takes time away from what I should be doing. :[ Just can't help it sometimes but at least I'm on no timeframes right now. So, I guess I'll show some of my ideas since I can.</p>
<p>Again, the plan for personal stuff is to get the Rainbow animation finished, but after that, I had an idea for an animated series. I quickly decided to not do this because it would be lame actually but I had a better idea now. The purpose of the animated series was to get some more animation practice. It would exist for nothing else. I don't like this approach so heres the new one: I will start a webcomic that is its own thing, and then I will sometimes animate certain scenes from it. Seems a little convoluted but this is my personal project and I can do what I want with it.</p>
<p>I would write more but I just now got bored so here's a picture</p>

<p>Okay so actually skrew it, I'll make this post long so that I can talk about this. As always, I have no idea if this project will even breath it's first breath. I have ideas like all the time and I'll never be able to bring them all to life. That said, I wanted this blog to show what my mind is currently on, even if it is stuff that won't go anywhere. So I'm forcing myself to post this so that even if it dies, it will have existed somewhere. Anyways, the comic is about this kid who wants to fight the ocean. They've got this box over their head so I wanted them to express emotion through color. These really sketchy drawings would be the actual rendered look of the whole comic. Like it will be intentionally this unpolished. And physical. For the most part. This should decrease time and effort needed and increase awesomeness at the same time. I'm hoping the end result is something really real? Hard to describe what I'm going for. But yeah this is pretty much what it would look like but the color thing will be rare.</p>
<p>There's a lot to figure out still before I start. And I don't mean story. I'll make up the story as I go. I mean distribution. So like, I have to put it on webtoons. I thing the scrolling mobile format is one of the best ways to read comics. Still, I'd want there to be a more traditional form too. Maybe it will have its own sub site on here. Maybe I can even do my own version of the scrolling webtoon thing on my own website. Lotta effort but maybe worth it? Idk but I'm weirdly passionate about this. I stop a lot of projects because they get too big in scope to manage, but this is something with an intentionally small scope. Or at least with low expectations? I'm not making this with the intention to get to an end, I'm making this just to make something. I think that might make some sense.</p>
<p>Yeah I'm not going back through to fix typos or mistakes up there</p>
<p>Uhhh i should just do something what am i still doing here</p>
