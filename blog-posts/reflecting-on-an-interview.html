<p class="date">9/5/24</p>
<p>I went to an interview yesterday for a job at a sign shop. I did not get the job, but I learned a lot from the experience. Primarily, I don't think my views align with a lot of professionals. </p>
<p>That doesn't mean I won't keep pursuing art as a profession, but who I am is contradictory to the professional art world. I love art. No matter where I am or what I'm doing, I find myself creating something. It's not really a choice for me. But I'm not stuck up about it. I very deliberately remind myself to not take things too seriously. I take art seriously, but I do not consider myself talented because that's what I do. I create things. I'm not more valuable than any other person just because I create things. Yes there is value in hard work. You don't see the hours of dedication every artist goes through to get where they are. And that deserves respect. But that doesn't make you more important. I am not more important than you. That's what I believe. And I don't think I can get along with people who strictly believe the opposite of that.</p>
<p>The artist who talked to me was very helpful. He told me things that most people wouldn't. He offered me great advice. His perspective on my character was inaccurate although warranted. I'm thankful for his time. But I do not wish to work for someone like him. We are not of the same mindset.</p>
<p>I think art is something I have to do on my own. I really like working freelance actually. I'll keep trying that. But when that doesn't work out, I'll be okay. Art does not have to be my job, because it is my life. </p>
<p>Thanks for the clarity _____. I'm leaving your name out, but trust me I won't forget it.</p>
