<h2>Fun Friday is exceeding my expectations</h2>
<p class="date">1/9/23</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/teBY89QLyNQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fun Friday</a> officially started last week, and I'm surprised out how well it performed. A well performing video for me is like anything with more than 20 views. I'm starting to worry that I've set the bar too high for myself, but only time will tell if I can manage to put out videos that do just as well. </p>

<p>Now that my next semester of school is starting, I'm worried that I won't be able to output much other than the weekly Friday video. I'd really like to stream again and I should really get some work done on my paid commission. I'll just have to wait and see if school is gonna take up too much time right now.</p>
<p>Other than the dreading my unstable future, I've been doing pretty good. I hope you're all doing good as well. :)</p>
