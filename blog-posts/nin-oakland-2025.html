<p>Last Wednesday, my friend MTD and I went to see Nine Inch Nails on their Peel It Back tour. It was really fun.</p>

<p>I’ve never been to a concert (depending on what you consider a concert) and I’ve always kind of assumed I wouldn’t like them. I’m a very quiet person and I generally like being in quiet places as well. Well, I can say pretty confidently that I was correct, but also I really really enjoyed this show. Basically, I don’t feel like going to other concerts, but this one was peak.</p>
<p>I think this is probably the live show I will enjoy most in my life. That seems like really high esteem, but yeah. I just have a hard time thinking about anything I could care about more that would also have a live show with as much of a visual experience that this one had. Well, actually maybe something orchestra would be sick to see. So yeah, I am exaggerating probably.</p>
<p>That’s all for now. See ya later</p>
