<p class="date">11/1/24</p>
<p>A month ago I made a post called <a href="https://flare145.com/blogpost?=i-like-bluesky" rel="nopener" target="_blank">I like bluesky</a>. I was just talking about how Bluesky as a platform was beginning to feel really usable following the Twitter ban in Brazil. Well, since then there has been another major surge of new users.</p>
<p>The behavior of the block feature on Twitter was changed so that it doesn't actually stop showing your posts to people you've blocked. This is stupid and caused a lot of people to look towards Bluesky as an alternative. The user agreement also changed, allowing Twitter to use user images as ai training data. This caused a lot artists to move as well, which I was quite happy about.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when it comes to art, I don't believe artists are much safer on Bluesky. Bluesky is built on the AT Protocol, which is sort of designed with the intent that everything is very public. This makes it very very easy for anyone to scrape everything on Bluesky to use as training data. Still, I'd rather people use Bluesky anyway because Twitter sucks and feels unusable way too often. I think artists today must get used to the fact that nothing posted is safe. I am comfortable with this now. I have the confidence that actual artists will not be fully replaced by ai, and I don't really care if ai steals from me. I know my choice should not apply to everyone, so if there is a way to fight back against generative ai, I will. But I don't personally care if my stuff is used as training data because there just isn't alot of it lol.</p>
<p>I haven't used Twitter actively in a few weeks now, and it's great. My timeline is generally much more positive. In general, several changes to my lifestyle have made my life more positive lately. Twitter will die a slow death. There are clearly still people holding on to it, and I do not fault them. Especially people whos livelihoods depend on maintaining an audience on the internet. But stepping back and thinking about how I've used twitter in my life, I see how it has been very unnecessary. Since Elon bought it, the experience has just gotten worse and worse, to the point where I really wasn't enjoying it. In a way, it's sad to let it go. But I am not sad. I've been refusing to call it X this whole time, but honestly, calling it Twitter doesn't feel appropriate anymore. It's not Twitter. It's simply not the same thing anymore. It's X now, and it sucks. </p>
<p>It won't be long until Elon makes another bad decision, so I expect more surges of new users every now and then. I wrote a long time ago that <a href="https://flare145.com/blogpost?=i-might-outlive-the-bird" rel="nopener" target="_blank">I might outlive the bird</a>, and as time crawls forward, I feel it becoming true. This website is my truest home. I wonder if there might come a day that I no longer use this website. It's not likely. This is the place that recognizes everything I've made that I care about. And I don't foresee a time that I don't make anything.</p>
<p>As a replacement for Twitter, Bluesky is great. I recommend it to anyone interested. Now then, onto tomorrow </p>
