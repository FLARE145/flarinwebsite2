<p class="date">3/8/24</p>
<p>I been playing minecraft and I've decided to dig a big hole. The goal is to hit bedrock.</p>

<p>Cool huh? I have some actual flare news to talk about so lets move on.</p>
<h3>Boxkid Updates</h3>
<p>I actually made some Boxkid progress this week! This is thanks to my new daily quest system I came up with. Inspired by my ability to complete Fortnite quests, I printed out a to-do list of sorts of daily objectives for me to complete. My goal is to complete one of three objectives every day. I missed the first day, but I've been productive ever since.</p>

  <figcaption>The dot means I completed that objective.</figcaption>

<p>I intend to post these every week on the brand new <a href="https://twitter.com/BoxkidComic" rel="nopener" target="_blank">Boxkid twitter page</a>. I just made it yesterday so the @ might change. I'm hoping that forcing myself to post these every week will force me to be more productive. </p>
<h3>Animation</h3>
<p>Am I finally working on Rainbow again? No lol. My job search is taking much longer than is comfortable, so I'm genuinely thinking of making some youtube slop content to see if that's a viable source of income for me. I have a decent idea of what I will make but it's too embarrassing for me to explain. Maybe next week. The point is, I want to see how easy it is for me to make an animation when I don't have to do everything myself. That is, not making my own rigs and characters and such. If I make any progress on this front, I'll definitely talk about it soon.</p>
<br>
<p>That's all for today. Hope you have a great week and I'll see you next time!</p>
