<p class="date">12/1/24</p>
<p>We've entered the final month of the year. Definitely not super happy with my creative output this year, but I rarely am. It takes time to make stuff.</p>
<p>If I want to get Boxkid out this year, I really only have a few days to do it. Most of my days will be occupied with work or Christmas preparation stuff for my family. I'm actually not sure if I can do it or not, but I'm not too worried. I'd be okay with it releasing January if needed. I'm still shooting for this year though so we'll see.</p>
<p>I spent way more time this year talking with friends, and I'm kind of indifferent to that. In some ways it feels like I wasted a lot of time, but it was probably beneficial to my mind in some ways. I usually feel bad because I don't really feel much when it comes to connecting with other people. I could probably go months without human contact and be fine. Too often I feel like hanging out is a cost I'm regularly taxed to appear like a normal person. It's a really guilty and gross feeling when I think about it. Partly and inspiration for my character Boxkid. That's not to say I don't enjoy company, it's just that I tend to detach myself from micro-life too much. It's the enjoyment I get from it that leads me to spend so much time with people.</p>
<p>Overall a pretty good year though. Have had many worse, and maybe only a few better. My mind is in a good place, which I am very thankful for. I hope to keep this up throughout next year.</p>
<p>I haven't had much to update on projects lately because all I'm really working on is Boxkid. Will talk more about where I'm at with that tomorrow probably. For now, I'm gonna go lay down in a blanket and commence the cozy/stressful month of December. See ya</p>
