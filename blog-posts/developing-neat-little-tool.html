<p class="date">5/12/24</p>
<p>I'm gonna be honest, I'm not quite sure how this week slipped by me so fast. I don't even really remember most of what I did. I think I was just too busy with work again? Anyways, let's get into what I do remember.</p>
<p>I've started working on a replacement for the blog tool I made over two years ago (it's been updated more recently though). I call this tool Mason. Mason is essentially the same as my current tool, but it will allow you to define your own blocks of HTML. It's hard to explain but this is useful to me. It will probably be available publicly on my website when it's done, but I don't think it will be useful to many people. I'm mainly working on this to help me with the Coaxion website I work on. I may or may not drop this project pretty quickly, as the only reason I started working on it now was because I was getting home to tired to work on anything art related.</p>
<p>That's all for this week. I'm likely posting a small new artwork during this next week. Not saying what it is right now so stay tuned for that.</p>
<p>PS thanks to all the moms out there</p>
