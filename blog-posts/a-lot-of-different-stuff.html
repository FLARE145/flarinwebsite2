<p class="date">1/29/24</p>
<p>This is probably going to be a very scattered post. My life is currently very scattered so that's probably why.</p>
<p>So lately I've been feeling the urge to work on Boxkid again. I haven't. I just got that urge. So I should act on that. Not sure what caused me to stop for so long, but hopefully I don't run into more issues. I'll provide updates on this again soon. Might redo some more of my Boxkid website stuff before release too. I don't want to get stuck with a sucky system forever. I'm thinking I want to add a dark mode, even though the pages themselves are going to be mostly white. Would just be nice I guess. Idk though I also have a lot of other stuff going on so the time I can give to Boxkid is really limited. Like I've said before though, Boxkid is my passion project. It will release eventually, but is never a priority. </p>
<p>I might try doing a dark theme on this website first. As a way to figure out how that works. I've also been thinking about how I can make the blog posts better. One of the problems with this blog is that there is no way to new when a new post comes out. I tried to solve this with rss but I didn't like that solution and I got rid of it. So, my current idea is to just choose a day and start making weekly posts. Or monthly. The point is, I want to decide on a consistent post schedule. That way, you can just check the blog on the expected post date. Maybe I could still post on extra days like holidays. This would also lead to longer posts, so I think that I would want to start incorporating headings into the posts. It would help me organize different topics better. Idk just some ideas.</p>
<p>I've also been thinking about getting into 3d printing. I think there is money to be made in 3d figure commissions. My idea is that people could commission me to take a 2d drawing and give them a hand-painted resin figurine. Would be very expensive but I think there might be an audience for that. And if there isn't, then I just end up with a cool 3d printer. So like cool for me I guess.</p>
<p>I guess the main thing I'm doing right now is the Coaxion game intro. It's going pretty well I think. Actually I should go work on that right now. See ya</p>
