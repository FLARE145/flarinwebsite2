<p>Gonna talk about the Mario movie in the next paragraph, so skip it if you want to get straight to other updates.</p>
<p>After seeing the new Mario movie trailer, I feel that I can confidently say I'm looking forward to seeing more. I don't think the story is going to be that great, but the visuals are enough to draw me in. Animation, lighting, and textures are on point. I approve of how they are pulling from the source material. It's very faithful to to the source, but the amount that they change things feels natural. I love how the penguins have their own little kingdom. It's setting expectations for the depth of the world building, which doesn't seem too deep or too shallow. Well, it might learn more towards shallow but it will be better than most of the games. Speaking of which, I wonder how much the movie will end up affecting the games. Will the world become a more consistent element in the franchise moving forward? Idk but it would be hella funny if they just did a tie-in game and then forgot about the whole thing. Also wow I kinda want a new Mario game. Like, when is that happening? Its been a while.</p>
<p>Alright so getting onto flare news. I've been cranking out a ton of DMCR achievement icons on stream. I think we've done 34 out of 51. I think 23 of them were done in the last month. Pretty good progress but I have school stuff so I'm slowing it down a bit now. Was fun to stream more while I could, even if it wasn't really the kind of stuff I'd want to stream. I think when I finish making the icons, I'd like to give them their own little page or something on the website. Like I need to make something that shows off examples of my work. I haven't fully fleshed out this idea so I'll continue thinking about it.</p>
<p>Fun Friday. When is it happening? Idk I keep delaying it. It wouldn't be hard to finish my announcement video, but I legit keep doing other stuff that gets in the way. I won't mind if the normal Fun Friday videos lack any quality at all, but I want the announcement trailer thingy to hit my normal standard. I'll get to it eventually, but wow. Its October and I originally meant to start mid September.</p>
<p>I have more random stuff to talk about but we'll save it for more posts. Gotta make the most of my life and efforts you know? Later bruahsani</p>
