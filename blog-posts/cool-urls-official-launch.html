<h2>cool-urls official launch</h2>
<p class="date">11/11/23</p>
<p>My new website cool-urls has now officially launched! It's really not that big of a deal but I'm making this blog post to link it because I already made two other posts about it. So yeah check it out at <a href="https://cool-urls.flare145.com" rel="noopener" target="blank">cool-urls.flare145.com</a>. To restate what it is, cool-urls is a list of websites I deem helpful, fun, or otherwise cool. Not much of a reason for it's existence, but idk I'm happy with it.</p>
<p>And with that I am done posting about this. Next post should be about my other ongoing projects again.</p>
