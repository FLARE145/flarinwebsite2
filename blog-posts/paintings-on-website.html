<p class="date">5/3/23</p>
<p>So amidst an adulting nightmare of trying to get a doctors appointment for the last few days, I've decided to work on the website some more. How are these things related? I don't know I think I just needed to distract myself. So yeah I did thing.</p>
<p>Art page now has featured and all tabs. These were previously locked to experimental mode but they are now legit. They don't currently function exactly how I intend, but they do function. We'll take all the wins we can get. </p>
<p>I also have finally managed to add 10 of the paintings I've been wanting to add for a while. It's been a whole process to edit my paintings to be ready for the website, so I'm not done with all of them. I'm not sure how long it will take to get them all in, but I will be adding a few every now and then.</p>
<p>I also improved performance on the projects page. The images should load faster now.</p>
<p>And that's pretty much it. I'll be getting back to phone call hell now</p>
