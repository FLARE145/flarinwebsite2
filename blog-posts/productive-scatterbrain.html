<p>This past week has felt very scattered, but I got more done than I intended. Which was not a lot but I'm still happy with that. </p>
<h3>Boxkid Progress</h3>
<p>For the first time since I think November, I actually drew more Boxkid! I've drawn an additional page, but I also scrapped another page that was already drawn. So total, I have 14 drawn pages and 13 edited for page format. I'm not expecting my pace to speed up, so maybe I'll be getting about a page per week done. I also went back and shot new photos for some previous pages because there were a few panels that I thought looked a little blurry. Overall, Boxkid is in fact, in production.</p>
<p>I also added dark theme to the Boxkid website. You might recall that I added dark theme here as a test for how it make work on there. Well that was kind of overkill because it turned out to be really easy to do on the Boxkid website. But hey, this website's dark theme is really nice to have too. Especially when I'm writing a blog post in the afternoon. The dark theme option isn't accessible yet because most of the website is still hidden, but It will be ready for when the site officially launches.</p>
<h3>Coaxion Related Updates</h3>
<p>I'm mostly done working on the Coaxion game intro for now. One of the previous website devs came back to work on the website too so that's almost off of my plate. This frees up my time more for Boxkid, animations, and just generally figuring out what to do with my life. Although, I still have a bunch of other stuff to do for Coaxion so maybe that's not the case. I'm making gamemode icons for dmcr on top of the achievement icons I still haven't finished. I'm honestly not sure where these land in terms of my personal priorities so we'll have to wait and see where things go. </p>

<p>I think the weekly blog thing is working the way I intend. I feel like I have a lot to write about, and it feels nice to know that these updates will be provided consistently. Now, it's time for me to go take a break from playing Fortnite all day, which is still an unfortunately large time sink for me. See you next week with hopefully even better news on Boxkid!</p>
