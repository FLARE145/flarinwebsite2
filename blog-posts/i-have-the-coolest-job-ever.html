<p class="date">6/7/25</p>
<p>I have now worked my first full week of my new job. It's been really great so far. I'm learning a lot and I feel like I am learning quickly. 8 hours there goes by really quick, so even though I'm working way more than I used to, I don't feel overwhelmed. An 8 hour shift at my old job felt so much worse. I think it's mostly because I find this job so much more interesting, but it could also be because I'm not dealing with the most annoying customers in the world. </p>
<p>Now that I've worked for a bit, I have a better sense of how this will effect my creative output. Basically, I should still be able to work on stuff. This week, I've just been gaming when I get home though. If I see my friends online, it's nice to just talk and game for a bit since I talk with them less now. There's no urgency to my personal projects, so I've been feeling really relaxed. Will likely work on RSS Plaza next week. Just a little bit.</p>
<p>In other news, I just managed to order a Switch 2 from Walmart yesterday, so I'm really excited to play that when it gets here next week. The nice thing about having a full time job that I intend to stay at for a long time is that I can actually game without any guilt again. Life is pretty awesome now.</p>
<p>Also weekends are so back?! The weekend became meaningless to me because my old job would schedule me different every week, so I was never guaranteed any consistent off days. Now I always have Saturday and Sunday off which is cool. Maybe my sense of the passage of time will improve. It certainly feels nicer at least.</p>
<p>That's all I got for now. Hope you're having a great day and see ya later</p>
