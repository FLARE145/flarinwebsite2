<p class="date">4/14/25</p>
<p>I posted a drawing! Today I posted a drawing of Marksman. This is a character by <a href="https://rahimali.net" rel="nopener" target="_blank">Rahim Ali</a>.</p>

<p>You can check out the <a href="https://flare145.com/artwork/di008" rel="nopener" target="_blank">artwork page</a> for more info.</p>
<p>Now that I have the RSS feed again, I think I'll try to always make a blog post whenever I upload artwork. Just a short little post like this one to notify people that I uploaded something. It's also cool as a sort of timestamp. Anyways, that's all for now, see ya later</p>
