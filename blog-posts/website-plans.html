		  <p>Right now, there are only 3 pages, being the landing, links, and blog pages. I plan on having a projects page that showcases work thats gone into my previous projects. Or something like that. It would become a lot more interesting once I get to work on personal projects that I've been wanting to work on for a while now. Not sure when that will happen because school and life, but one day I'll get around to it. I also might make a gallery page, which will act as a previous work portfolio sort of thing.</p>
