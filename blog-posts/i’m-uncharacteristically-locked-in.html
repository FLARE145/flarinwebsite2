<p class="date">9/9/25</p>
<p>Or maybe I was uncharacteristically locked out for like, a long time.</p>
<p>I haven’t been writing blog posts because I haven’t done much that makes sense to share here. Mostly, I’ve been working, and the rest of the time has been spent on commissions. Well, my free time is spent on a couple things now, but notably, not gaming. Y’know what. Day in the life of me time.</p>
<h3>A day in the life of FLARE145</h3>
<p>2:30 a.m. – I wake up for a bit. Usually to use restroom. I go back to sleep very happy knowing I still get to rest for longer.</p>
<p>4:30 a.m. – I wake up before my alarm set for 5:00. My goal is actually to get up by 4:40 but I’m just risky like that. Look at phone (Bluesky/Discord).</p>
<p>4:40 a.m. – Get up and stretch. Getting ready for my morning run (no I don’t identify as a “sigma”).</p>
<p>5:00 a.m. – Run (roughly 15 minutes). Plank for 1:30. 20 push-ups. 5 ish negative pullups/hang. </p>
<p>5:30 a.m. – Shower.</p>
<p>5:50 a.m. – Make lunch (white bread + peanut butter).</p>
<p>5:55 a.m. – Make breakfast (3 eggs). Eat with YouTube.</p>
<p>6:20 a.m. – Teeth brush. Make sure I have everything I need for work.</p>
<p>6:30 a.m. – Read bible (NABRE (will likely go more into why I'm doing this soon)).</p>
<p>6:50 a.m. – Phone (Bluesky/Discord).</p>
<p>7:10 a.m. – Leave for work.</p>
<p>8:00 a.m. – Start work.</p>
<p>4:30 p.m. – Leave work. (my work day can be pretty varied so I'm not getting detailed with it here)</p>
<p>5:20 p.m – Get home. Eat food (thanks mom).</p>
<p>6:00 p.m. – Get on pc and start working (Currently doing logo commissions).</p>
<p>8:00 p.m. – Log off and chill. YouTube. Brush Teeth.</p>
<p>9:00 p.m. – Sleep.</p>
<p>11:00 p.m. – Start dreaming. Last night I dreamt about scary dark locations where I expected to see fnaf animatronics, but I never actually ran into anything. True story.</p>
<p>2:30 a.m. – Wake up for a second to use the restroom. Still got extra time to rest which is nice.</p>
<p>Err that’s the loop. Let me know if I got anything wrong.</p>
<p>So yeah. Actually, I’m going a trip out of state this weekend, so this schedule won’t apply to those days, but I won’t be working on cool stuff those days anyways. Maybe I’ll blog though. And if you’re wondering how I had time to write this post, it’s because I broke schedule today. I actually went to a store to buy a rain suit for the trip, which set me back like a whole hour because of traffic. So I just casually watched some YouTube and while writing this for an hour.</p>
<p>That’s all for today. I’m hoping to get some stuff off my plate soon, so maybe I’ll get back to Boxkid in two weeks? We’ll see how this ages. Anyways yeah, see ya</p>
