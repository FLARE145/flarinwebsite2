<p>Host of Game Theory Matpat just retired from the channel, so I felt I should mention it. I started watching Game Theory before the first FNAF theory, so you know I've been around for a long time. It's been crazy to see the channel grow and evolve over the years, and I'm really grateful in particular for the videos that covered relevant internet topics instead of the game stuff. I'm going to keep watching because I like the show, but I know it won't feel the same. Thank you Matpat and see you later.</p>
<p>Sorry I missed my Friday post. And Saturday. I know it doesn't really matter but I like trying to be consistent for myself. I've just been pretty tired lately. But here I am now so let's get to it.</p>
<h3>Boxkid Updates</h3>
<p>I failed even more this week lol. I got a 4/7 for my daily objectives. I definitely will give myself Sundays as a break, but otherwise, I just failed. Didn't realize how hard it would be to focus on that on days that I work a lot. I'm still going to shoot for 6/7 next week though. Although, I am considering moving this project down a little bit in priority.</p>
<h3>New Project!</h3>
<p>So I think I mentioned this last week, but I'm starting a new animation project. This will be a series titled <em>Axo Plays Minecraft</em>. Episodes will be designed for short form video, so they are under a minute long and rendered in portrait orientation for phones. The idea is that I might be able to make a bit of money by engaging in a little bit of lucrative kids content, while also being able to test my skills in animation. I want to focus on character animation so that I can put good clips into my animation portfolio and hopefully land a nice job with that. I know this isn't very cool or original, but I'm still putting effort into this project. I don't want to make something that is genuinely just slop content. I want to make something that people can actually enjoy. I'll provide more updates on this in future blog posts.</p>

<h3>The Hole</h3>
<p>Remember the Minecraft hole from last week? Well I got a lot of help and we finished it pretty quickly. Here it is:</p>

<p>Was very fun but now I have no idea what to do with my life.</p>
<br>
<p>That's it for today. Looks like I have a lot of work ahead of me if I want to finish all the stuff I want to put out. Gonna get on Minecraft right now to look at the hole. See you all later!</p>
