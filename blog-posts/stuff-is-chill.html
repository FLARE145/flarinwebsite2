<p>I'm not sick anymore so that's nice. Longest I've been sick in a long time. It was really weird honestly. Even though I'm feeling better, I think I still don't want to dive headfirst back into full focus working. It's been a nice change of pace and I don't want to overwhelm myself. I'm going to animate a bit this week, and hopefully next week, I'll get back to Boxkid in some form.</p>
<p>Speaking of animating, I have been working on episode two of Axo Plays Minecraft! Things have been going slow, but I like what I'm cooking. Again, this series serves two purposes. First, I'm practicing 3d animation. I'm using assets I didn't have to create myself in order to more purely focus on animation. And second, it would be nice to get a few views along the way. I'm feeling good about what I'm animating, and I'm excited to make more for my portfolio. Here's a screenshot from episode 2:</p>

<p>Moving on, I might be getting a new job soon. I really love the job I have, but since I'm not currently enrolled in any school, it doesn't make as much sense to work there at the moment. If I'm able to get this new job, I'll be able to save money faster than I am right now. This will likely affect my creative output, so I'm a little worried about it. More than that though, I will miss the people I work with. I'm very grateful to have a set of coworkers who are fun to work with and good people. Even if I don't get a new job right now, I will miss them when I do.</p>
<p>With the job stuff and the turn of the season, I've been feeling a strange heaviness. Like change is on it's way and I don't feel quite ready to move on. With it though, comes the excitement of new experiences. My life has been tough journey from my perspective, and usually it's me that makes it tough. I will try my best to not get in the way of myself, but I'm scared that I will. But regardless of anything that happens, I will continue to make art. The world can slow me down, but it can't stop me. I hope you have a great week. See you later.</p>
