<h2>Projects page development</h2>
<p class="date">11/7/22</p>
<p>Before I get into the topic in the title, I'd like to mention that the DMCR achievement icons are nearing completion. I've made all of the icons themeselves, they just need to be given the final touches in blender. I'm still not sure how long that might take, but I'm already looking ahead towards what I'll be doing afterwards.</p>

<p>This is what lead me to work on the projects page. You see, I mentioned previously that I wanted to dedicated a page to the icons because I put a lot of time into them. Well, now that they are almost done, I'm setting up the ground work to make this page. I've spent some time working on the projects page now, and I think it's pretty much ready. I just need to make actual pages dedicated to individual projects. This will happen very slowly, so it might just go up with only the icons.</p>
<p>Another issue is linking it to the main page. I really like the current layout and I don't want to change it too much. So my idea is to get rid of the links button and replace it with projects. I just think the links button is kind of a weird unnecessary step now that I have the bottom red area on the main page. I can just move the links down there somewhere. The links page itself will still exist, but it will only be reachable with the url. At least that's the plan for now. I'm not sure what to do about the new tile for the projects page yet. I might just repurpose the old one and put the new text on it. Idk making the tile is actually probably going to be the hardest part of this whole thing. That's what happened with the art page. I finished making it before I finished making the icon for it.</p>
<p>Going to get back to whatever I'm doing. Homework? Yeah I have homework. Oh also gotta double check my ballot. Vote if you can yall and see you later</p>
