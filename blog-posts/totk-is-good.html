<p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> is so good that I'm planning on limiting my daily playtime to one hour. I can't stop playing. I've played for a long time already and there's still so much for me left to do. And it keeps being fun! It's pretty crazy how good this game is honestly. But yeah, hopefully I play it less now so that I can get back to doing something with my life.</p>
<p>Uhhh um whats new uhm. Oh I added a project page for Feel the Burn. I don't remember if I've done anything else so... That's all for today!</p>
