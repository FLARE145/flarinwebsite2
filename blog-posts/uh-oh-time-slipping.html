<p class="date">11/23/25</p>
<p>I just checked and it turns out it has been nearly a month since the last post. I had to have been intending to post probably like every other day during that time lol. I just genuinely never got around to it. Honestly I don't remember everything I actually wanted to talk about, so this will just be a house-keeping update. </p>
<h3>Boxkid</h3>
<p>Okay progress on my comic has been really slow. It's a struggle to work on after work for whatever reason, so I basically haven't worked on it. My guilt finally built up enough last week and I forced myself to draw a little bit so that was good. Unfortunately December is going to be busy, so I'll likely have to hold off on it entirely until I get through the month. It's looking like ch.2 won't be ready until well over a year since the first one.</p>
<h3>Gaming</h3>
<p>My Switch 2 is convenient to play during lunch at work which is really nice. Been doing more gaming in the afternoon too because of my previously explained lack of productive energy after work. DK Bananza. Peak. I beat Metroid Dread which I played half of like a year or two ago. It was peak. And now I've been playing the new Hyrule Warriors and Kirby Air Riders. Both are really good but I haven't "finished" them. It's really nice to enjoy myself but hopefully I can find the will to do more cool things instead.</p>
<h3>Impending doom</h3>
<p>My parents are planning to replace all the floor in the house soon including my room. This will be occurring during the first week of December, so I'm scrambling to clean and organize this horrifically kept environment to make it suitable for easy boxing and moving. Problem is I only have 2 hours a day to work with, and I really really don't like doing this stuff, so I'm slow. I'm honestly considering renting a storage unit for a month to start offloading some of my stuff into there. I have way a lot of stuff. Pc parts, cables, Lego, books, sports gear, camera gear, artwork, art supplies, legal documents, and yeah some clothes I guess. Mostly the problem is that I'm a mess and I desperately need a filing cabinet. So yeah, hopefully that goes well.</p>
<p>So yeah between that and Thanksgiving and Christmas stuff, I won't be able to do interesting stuff for a while. Idk maybe I lock in somehow and I increase my will out of nowhere. Thats all for now see ya</p>
