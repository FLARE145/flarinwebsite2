<p class="date">11/9/23</p>
<p>So two big things happened lately that I want to talk about for a bit.</p>
<p>First, the Five Nights at Freddy's movie finally came out. I watched it on release with my friends and it was really enjoyable. I was 11 when the first game came out so the franchise is sort of a core part of my childhood. It was surreal to see on the big screen. It is objectively not a good movie, but I loved it. Just felt like an important event in the universe. I could talk much more about the movie but all that really matters is that I think it is enjoyable. It made me unreasonably happy.</p>
<p>Second, the finale to Attack on Titan released. I've been following the anime for a long time now (though not from the start) so it is very significant to me emotionally. Attack on Titan is easily my favorite piece of media of all time and the finale cemented that. AOT is all I've been thinking about for the past few days and I feel like that wont stop anytime soon. It's honestly a hard show for me to recommend to most people, but if you have never seen it and have nothing to do, you should really watch it. My heart goes out to Etika and everyone else who never got to see the other side of the walls. Shinzou sasageyo</p>
<p>I'd like to talk about what I've been up to since the last post, but I think I'll save most of that for another day. Today, I actually just made another website for fun. I'm not gonna link it because the name might change, but it is out there right now. Pretty proud of it considering I made it in one day, although it is very simple. It would be <em>cool</em> if you managed to find it without a <em>url</em>. I'll talk about it soon so see you then.</p>
