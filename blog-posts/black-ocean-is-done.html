<p class="date">12/9/23</p>
<p>Black Ocean is what I've decided to name that Coaxion animation I've been working on. Now that it is complete, I spent some time this morning making the <a href="https://flare145.com/projects/black_ocean" target="_blank" rel="noopener">project page</a> for it. I had a lot of fun making this and I hope to get back to animating more stuff soon.</p>
<p>I made this post just for that one update, but I will be making more blog posts on various topics over the coming days. Not much in the works right now other than boxkid. Just want to give a few life updates and such.</p>
