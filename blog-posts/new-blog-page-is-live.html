<p class="date">9/30/22</p>
<p>Okay so obviously this isn't that big a deal, but it kind of is to me. The page no longer contains every post I've ever written because I've finally implemented an actual loading system. I talked about doing something like this in post from like a year ago, but I've actually gone and done it now. It's so much nicer. There's still some mess to clean up but I'll get around to it soon. For now, I'll just relax and be happy with my work.</p>
<p>In addition to the blog changes, I've brought my ad functionality out of experimental mode. Ads now show up after every ten blog posts, starting with the second. I know that sounds weird but trust me it makes sense. The ad thing is mostly a joke but I see it as an other thing that makes the site feel less dead. If anyone wants an ad just talk to me. I'll probably do it for free in most cases since it's not like they'd actually drive traffic or anything. </p>
<p>That's all for today. I intend to post a bit more often again and I'll try my best to make them more interesting. Bye and have a good day!</p>
