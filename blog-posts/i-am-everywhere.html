<p class="date">1/24/24</p>
<p>I was recently given an invite code to <a href="https://toyhou.se/FLARE145" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Toyhouse</a>.(thank you <a href="https://toyhou.se/florblorb"rel="noopener"target="_blank">florb</a>!) This coupled with my recent activity on Bluesky made me realize just how far spread my online identity has become. I'm starting to think I should overhaul my links page soon. I'm worried I will make it more boring, but it was already the most boring page so I guess that doesn't matter.</p>
<p>I have a lot to say about my experience with Toyhouse so far, so you can probably skip this whole blog post if you don't care. First of all, I want to say that I had no idea what this was until like a week ago. I also want to mention that some of this might sound like I'm complaining, but I am not. I am grateful to be a user of this website now. There are just some differences between the culture there and how I personally approach my art. Let's get into it.</p>
<p>I've learned that the best way to describe Toyhouse is to call it a public character repository. You upload art and tag the relevant character(s). On top of that, you can trade or adopt characters with other users. From this description, you can understand the exact kind of audience this is geared towards. This website is for people who participate in the culture of drawing and sharing oc's (original characters). I am someone who is an artist, but there is this really hard to describe difference between me, and the type of artist who interacts with art in this way. Yeah I think different type of artist is the best way to describe this. There are many different types of artists. A street artist would not relate entirely to someone who is a painter. They are playing different games, with different rules, and different vocabulary. My art is really centered around my own reoccurring characters. My main focus is composition. A character is one part of that. Toyhouse is a place largely for artists whose focus is their characters. That makes it a very cool and unique platform. There is probably not a single better place for this exact type of artist. I just so happen to not be that type of artist.</p>
<p>So does this mean I don't like it? No, that is far from the case. I think it's cool, but I just won't be as active there as I am on other platforms. It's unfortunate because the exclusivity makes me feel bad for not being drawn to use it. Obviously I know that there is no actual obligation and it's just in my mind, it just bugs me. That said, I did put some Boxkid stuff on there. Boxkid is the only thing that really makes sense for me to show there for now, but I intend to upload some more at a future time. Overall, Toyhouse is cool.</p>
<p>Oh and they let you do custom html on your profile page so I had a blast messing with that. Will likely mess with it some more. Anyways thanks for reading if you happen to be here. I've got more random nonsense to discuss next time.</p>
