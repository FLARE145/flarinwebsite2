<p class="date">9/28/22</p>
<p>So seo or search engine optimization has been something I always prioritized while making this website. It was the main reason I went back and created those individual pages for the blog posts. Well, I think I'm gonna part ways with that mentality soon.</p>
<p>Seo was important to me because I liked being able to search flare145 and see my website as one of the top results. As I've recently mentioned, I'm in a state where I can't be proud of any of my previous accomplishments anymore. It's hard to explain, so I won't, but basically I don't care If no one ever knows who I am. I would honestly prefer it. However, I still enjoy making stuff, so I shall continue for the sake of my own enjoyment.</p>
<p>What does this mean? I'm gonna restructure how the blog works behind the scenes. Everything will work the same from the user side, but I have a lot of work ahead of me. Basically, the page will generate itself by adding together a bunch of separate files. I could go more in depth but this is not the place for that I think. Also you can just view the code yourself once these changes happen.</p>
<p>An added benefit of these changes would be that I might post more often again. The current system is annoying to post with so it prevents me from writing posts on the fly like I used to. I've been feeling better lately as well, so I'm more comfortable with the idea of posting more.</p>
<p>Finally, I'd like to address the ending of my last post. Yes, I am currently working on starting Fun Friday again. I wouldn't say its something to get excited about, but it is something that you could consider to be 'content'. I will be back soon with other various pieces of news, but know that I am just one dude trying to animate, stream, develop, work, and study. It's always gonna be slow going, but I'm always going.</p>
