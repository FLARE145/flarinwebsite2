<p class="date">8/5/25</p>
<p>I'm a huge fan of visual art, and I'm very well versed in it. Music however, is almost unapproachable to me. I love music a lot, and I have ideas for songs all the time actually. They're just not very good.</p>
<p>I think it's much harder to get into making music than it is to start drawing. All you need is something to draw with and something to draw on. You could say music is similarly accessible, but I would consider environment to be a requirement. I can draw in my room and no one would know, but I can't just start singing and making a bunch of noise. It's also much harder to capture what you make. It's easier to make a photo of a drawing look good than to make a recording of a song sound good. I think these are the main reasons I never really progressed in music creatively whereas I got a lot further in drawing and digital art.</p>
<p>When I was in school, I played the flute for like 5 years. I enjoyed and hated it (long story) but I do miss feeling like I was making music, even though I was just performing. I like the idea of doing a performance that can be recorded. That's a little bit of what I gained from doing video. But I think I could do better. I'd like to do an album sometime where it's just me singing and maybe I have like a tambourine. The thing is, I'd have to write good lyrics for that to work, and I haven't been much of a poet.</p>
<p>Poetry is an other thing I never really got into. I mean I like poetry, but I don't write it. Makes sense why I don't make music either now. Even when I read a lot of poetry, I liked longer poems that focused less on structure. Idk. At some point I have to accept that I can't be good at all the things I like. Honestly the fact that I'm not good at those things makes them more awesome. </p>
<p>I try to sing sometimes in my car now, since I have a long drive to work. My voice is kinda weird and not suited to a lot of stuff that I listen to. I can sing Harley Poe songs decently accurately and that's about it. Still, I think if I made music, I wouldn't care how my voice sounds. It would be more about the words and meaning, but yeah I'm bad at that as previously mentioned.</p>
<p>Maybe I'll start with poetry</p>
