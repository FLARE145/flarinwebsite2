<p class="date">2/2/24</p>
<p>I've worked on a lot of stuff actually. I'm going to separate this post into separate topics using fancy html heading tags. </p>
<h3>Updates to blog</h3>
<p>See? Isn't that fancy? Technically I always had the ability to add those headings, but it wasn't in like, the rules in my head of how I write these. Also I updated my blogtool to let me add headings fast. Also I think I am going to experiment with weekly posts. I'm picking Friday. So this is my first weekly Friday post. Hopefully I can find something to talk about every week.</p>
<h3>Website dark theme</h3>
<p>I added dark mode! It took me like two days but it works pretty well. There is a settings button on the main page that lets you enable it. You can also enable fancy background, although it still isn't entirely stable. Experimental mode now does nothing, and the secret settings shortcut has been removed.</p>
<h3>Boxkid progress</h3>
<p>Okay so I haven't drawn more, but I have been editing pages together. So now there are 3 new finished pages in me folder. I am going to make the hard prediction that chapter 1 will be ready to release within two months. I could be wrong but idk. It will come out when I'm happy with it, but I do see myself being happy with it soon. Not too many pages left I think. Especially since I cut the chapter down shorter so that it has a more consistent pace. I'm really excited for it though. I don't care if no one ends up liking it. I think it's cool.</p>
<h3>Coaxion game intro</h3>
<p>I don't remember if I've mentioned this but I've been doing another animation for Coaxion. This one is actually supposed to be used in the games so that's cool. It's been going well so far but I think the final details are going to take a while. This is what I spend most of my time on right now. After this, I hope to get back to making my own animation. And Boxkid some more.</p>
<h3>Um. Do I just label this part goodbye?</h3>
<p>Yeah that's it. Check back next week to see if I actually get anything done on ongoing projects. bruahsani</p>
