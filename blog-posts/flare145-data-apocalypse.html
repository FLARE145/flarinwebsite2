<p>Guys I'm gonna be honest, I flew too close to the sun with this one. I'm officially declaring code red. Okay maybe it's not that serious but still. Allow me to explain the situation.</p>
<p>Essentially, I'm kind of pushing the storage limit of the website. The storage limit for the hosting service I'm using is about 1GB. I didn't know this until today. I've been uploading more of my paintings to show off on my website, and each of these images are large. Like 3000 x 3000 pixels large. This means like 25MB per image and I just added like 20 new ones lol. Only 5 of the new ones are set up to be viewable, but the images can be reached with the correct url.</p>
<p>The main problem is that I'm within about 100MB of the storage limit, and it seems to be affecting the load times of the images. Some of the images refuse to load unless you try loading the exact url. So, I need to find a separate service to host these large image files, which is kind of a bummer but I guess this was always going to happen at some point.</p>
<p>I'm currently looking into using Imgur for image hosting, but I haven't made a concrete decision yet. This move will cause some of my art links to break, but those aren't used anywhere but here, so that shouldn't be a big deal. </p>
<p>So yeah. I might not fix this for a few days. If you want to know when the website is fixed, the newsbar on the main page should reflect the current status. That is all. I must go prepare for the migration</p>
