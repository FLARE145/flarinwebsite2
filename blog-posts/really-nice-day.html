<p class="date">9/6/21</p>
<p>I didn't have class today because of Labor Day, so I finally sort of got a break from catching up on school work. I enjoyed my freedom for a good chunk of the day, but the rest of my time was spent working on my newest project.</p>

<p>The model is still going to be worked on plenty, but this is a decent start. I hope that I can keep up the pace because rendering the video might take up more time than I would like it too. There's going to be a lot of stuff like glass, which will probably force me to render at higher samples.</p>
<p>I feel like I'm going to have a fun time working on this, even if I don't end up making the deadline.</p>
