<p class="date">9/28/24</p>
<p>Lately I've been feeling better, and I've had the focus to start re-building my routines. This has allowed me to consistently feel productive, and to re-gain a sense of self-accomplishment. I thought I might go over some of what I've been doing to help myself, and maybe this can help you if you choose to follow any advice.</p>
<h3>My routine recommendations</h3>
<p>The first thing I'm going to recommend is to start using to-do lists. To-do lists are your greatest tool for starting good habits, and also for integrating non-routine activities into your life. You're brain is not good at keeping track of tasks. You're goal should be to take some of this load off of your brain, and into some other space. Paper to-do lists are great, but if you want some app recommendations, I recommend Google Tasks or TickTick. These are both very simple and easy to understand. I currently use Tasks, and it's working really well for me. It works with Google calendar which is helpful to me, and I like getting notifications on my phone that remind me of my tasks.</p>
<p>Setting up reoccurring tasks is an easy way to get into building a routine. My favorite reoccurring task is to do my bed. Seriously. For some people this is easy to do and normal, but for me, I don't consistently do it without the reminder. It's the easiest "win" of the day, I seriously recommend doing this if you want to become productive at all. It also disincentives laying in bed all day, which is good for reasons I don't have to explain.</p>
<p>The next thing I'd recommend is to pay attention to how you operate. I found that I'm better at certain tasks during different times of the day. Once you figure out what you have the energy for, you can plan your days accordingly, and suddenly, you'll find yourself living more efficient days. This advice works best if you've managed to make your sleep and wake times consistent.</p>
<p>Sleeping consistently. No one really does this, not even me, but I do have a few pointers that might help. The first is to give up on the night life. Why? Because the best tool for waking up consistently is the sun. Leave your blinds open when you go to sleep so that the sun illuminates your room in the morning. After a week or so, you'll find that you can wake up at this time without feeling horrible. If you feel that you are waking up consistently, but not going to sleep consistently, try adding more physical activity to your daily routine. Running or walking are ideal, but if you don't live in a area where that is feasible, just try doing some push-ups. You can do it pretty much anywhere. Even if there somehow isn't space for that in your room, just go outside. Literally the sidewalk even. Just do as many as you can, on your knees if you have to, and try to do the same or more the next day. Even if this doesn't help with the sleep, the endorphins should help you feel just a little better anyway. </p>
<p>Routines don't have to be super strict. Most people are not in situations where they can sleep consistently. Jobs, family life, and mental health are all things that can run counter to the goal of consistency. However, this doesn't make routine building impossible. Most of my own goals are based on sequence, rather than set time. For example, I do my bed first, and then I wash the dishes. Neither of these have a set time, but they exist relative to one and other. </p>
<h3>Boxkid Routine</h3>
<p>Lately I've actually been able to consistently work on my Boxkid comic, and this is thanks to to techniques I've described above. My old method of motivation was a task list of multiple things I can work on to progress Boxkid. This worked for a bit, but because my goal was to strictly accomplish two of the tasks per day, I had days where I wasn't meeting my goal, and I got demotivated. My new system is this. If the sun is out and I'm not at work, I draw for Boxkid until I am tired or feel uninspired. Then, I get on my computer and do any computer work I have for the comic, like editing the pages. </p>
<p>This was worked really well for me, and it is helped me work on Boxkid even during one of my busiest weeks at work. Some days, I went to work in the morning and edited the comic at night. Other times, I drew a panel in the morning and went to work after. Instead of being concerned about working on it in a certain sequential way, my work on Boxkid is dependent on daylight. This is because I learned that being on the computer while the sun is out usually doesn't feel too good, and trying to draw when it's dark and I'm tired doesn't go well. In the end, it's all about learning about yourself.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>If you feel like you used to be a more productive person in the past, chances are that there are objective circumstances that make you a productive person. Study yourself. Not paying attention to yourself is an easy way to let your life control you. I wish everyone the best of luck in living the life they want to live, and I hope at least some of this advice is useful or inspiring. Thank you for reading. I'll be back in the next post with an actually significant progress update on <em>Boxkid vs. the Ocean</em></p>
