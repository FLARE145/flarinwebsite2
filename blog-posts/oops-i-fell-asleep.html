<p class="date">2/24/24</p>
<p>I've been doing weekly blog posts for like 3 weeks and I already lost my streak. I was supposed to write one yesterday but I was tired and I fell into a deep slumber. Like a good 13-hour slumber. Anyways, I'm awake now so let's do this one day late.</p>
<p>Last week, I wrote what I thought was a motivational positive outlook on the future of art considering the threat that generative ai poses. I've been told it does not read like that. I want to clarify that my point was that I will keep making art no matter what gets in the way of me doing that. The future of making money off of art looks bleak, but it isn't about money for me. Okay, done with the serious stuff for hopefully a long time. Let's move on.</p>
<h3>Erm, where's Boxkid?</h3>
<p>Uhh... Okay look it is very hard for me to draw interiors so I'm kind of stuck on drawing a single page. I keep restarting because it doesn't feel right. I'm probably overthinking things and I should just get on with it. I'll provide the next Boxkid update when I actually make some progress. I've just been a bit busy with some other stuff too.</p>
<h3>145 Subscribers!</h3>
<p>I just passed 145 YouTube subscribers! I wanted to make a 145 sub special because that's the funny flare number, but I didn't have enough time. I had no concrete idea for what it could be either, so I've decided to not even do it as a late upload. Mentioning it on here so that the moment is documented. I hope that uploading more animations will increase the success of my channel. Feels wild to have over 100 in general. Thanks everyone!</p>
<h3>Cube</h3>
<p>I just got on the cube and nothing else matters anymore. My brother taught me how to solve a rubiks cube and I quickly became addicted. Like for real. I usually cube first thing in the morning. I'm down to an average time of under 2 minutes. Haven't gotten much faster anymore. Cube. It's so fun I can't even explain it. Probably gonna cube after this.</p>
<br>
<p>That's it for this late post. The new Splatoon dlc just came out so I might be streaming that today or tomorrow. Or just soon. So I'm looking forward to streaming again because I don't that too often. See you there! Or if not, I'll be here in lame text form next week. On time. Hopefully. Later!</p>
