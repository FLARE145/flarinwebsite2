<p class="date">12/31/21</p>
<p>Honestly kinda depressing how fast the year has gone by. Its crazy to think about projects I've worked on because so many of them are starting to seem like a good while ago. Trinket Trouble was already a whole year ago. I started my failed webcomic two years ago. Doesn't feel like that long. Though sometimes it does feel like forever ago so maybe it just depends on my mood.</p>
<p>Anyways I have cool news today. I finally linked the art page! I finished drawing the icon this morning. I think I'm going to tweak all of the icons a bit more because they're a little jank, but I'm still happy with how things look right now. I probably won't be working on the website much anymore. Like there is still a lot I'd want to do, but none of them are of priority to me. I guess the next big thing would be the projects page, but that seems like a lot of work. I'll talk about that more whenever I decide to make it.</p>
<p>I've been streaming a decent amount and its been fun. I beat Half-Life Blue Shift so now I can finally start Half-Life 2. I probably wont for a bit though. I'm thinking of playing through spore on stream soon. Stream stuff is fun but sometimes I wish I could do more stupid streams again. Stuff like when I just did my homework. I want to read a whole book on stream but I don't want to force anyone to watch that. Maybe I'll do that in secret. I have been thinking about what else might be entertaining to watch and I have a few ideas I'm going to try soon.</p>
<p>I've gotten a decent amount of work done on my next artwork. It's looking pretty cool, although I still won't be done with it for another while. I want it to look perfect, so I'm taking my time. I haven't been putting images often so here you go. An actual work in progress pic.</p>

<p>Moving on uhhhh, I forgot what else I was going to talk about. It's been an okay year for all of the creative endeavors and I hope to carry that through into 2022. See you all next year.</p>
