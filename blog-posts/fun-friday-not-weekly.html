<p class="date">4/24/23</p>
<p>Just thought that I should acknowledge the fact that I am no longer making a Fun Friday video every week. It's slightly disappointing, but I always knew that this was a possibility. I've been really happy though since I now have more time to work on different stuff.</p>
<p>One of those things is website related. I've been working through my photos of paintings, preparing them to be hosted on my website. In general, I'm going to try focusing on putting more of my work on the art page. I want it to be something that I'm proud to show to anyone. I've been making good progress, but I can't give an estimate as to when this might go into effect.</p>
<p>I've also been working some more stuff for DMCR. I'll make sure to post stuff about it when I'm done, or at least closer to done.</p>
<p>I do plan on uploading a Fun Friday this week, as long as I can get around to editing it. I received some goodies from dial-up studios and I wanted to show it on camera. Not super fun, but I think it's at least a little bit interesting.</p>
<p>That is all. I will now be patiently waiting to play Crab Champions with my friends today. Life is good</p>
