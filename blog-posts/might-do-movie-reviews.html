<p class="date">6/7/22</p>
<p>I've got a few updates todays. First is that I got a job now! Sort of. I still need to wait for them to finish a background check but I've been a good boy so I pretty much have the job. It will be nice to have money again to help fund my creative shenanigans so I'm really happy about this.</p>
<p>Okay lets get down to business. I can technically say that I've been streaming again. I've done two more streams since the last post. I did a painting stream last week and I just did a short stream this morning where I watched the latest Sonic Central. I plan to do a gaming stream in the afternoon as well. So, it would appear that at the moment, streams are most likely to happen on Tuesday.</p>
<p>I've been working a bit more on my next animation. It's definitely going to be a while before it releases, but I hope to get some good work in before I get too busy again. Development of the website has completely halted because I'm now using that time to focus on the animation and other stuff I have to do.</p>
<p>Finally, I just wanted to mention that I might do reviews on the blog now. I'll review anything whenever I feel like it. Movies, games, literally anything. I might review a rock at some point idk all that matters is that it will probably happen.</p>
<p>That's all for now. Thanks for reading and have a good day!</p>
