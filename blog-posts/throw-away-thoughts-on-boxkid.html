<p class="date">9/6/23</p>
<p>I've drawn 10 pages of my upcoming comic Boxkid Vs. the Ocean, although I'm not done editing them. I've been estimating Ch.1 to be about 30 pages in length, but I'm suddenly forced to make some release decisions right now.</p>
<p>I would feel comfortable releasing these 10 pages, but in terms of the story, nothing really happens in those first pages. I'd want the first chapter to feel like the first part of a pilot episode, but right now, it feels like the opening minute. Again, I'd be fine with this, but it would be months before anyone would be able to see a continuation, and therefore months before people really find out what the story is actually about.</p>
<p>Shorter chapters would let me update the comic more often, but the reader might not feel as satisfied. Especially at the beginning. So I'm not entirely sure what to do.</p>
<p>I said that BK was going to be my project that I care the least about, so I'm leaning towards the quicker releases. It will make less sense, but I think it's better to have something out there. Once things start to make more sense, more people will get interested. Hopefully the art style attracts readers on it's own.</p>
<p>The one thing is that I wonder if I should call the updates something other than chapters. I think chapter might imply something a lot longer, and in my head, I would know how many chapters constitute a "complete chapter." Maybe I'm not making any sense.</p>
<p>Okay so uh. Did I say anything of importance? Not sure. I guess if there's anything to take away from this, it's that BK might start soon. Or it might not. Thanks for reading! See you then hopefully</p>
