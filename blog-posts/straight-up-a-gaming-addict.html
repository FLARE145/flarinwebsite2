<p>There's this game called Crab Champions that I've been playing recently. It's made by the guy who made that crab rave video, but its a like a shooty game with rouge-like elements. Noisestorm is what the dev goes by I think. But yeah, I've played over 10 hours of it in the past week. That is a lot of gaming for me. It genuinely is eating into my time but I love it. It's surprisingly super good. Hopefully I'm over it soon though.</p>
<p>Had a really strange weekend but I'm feeling weirdly positive now. We'll see what I manage to get done this week. Hopefully gonna work some more on my commission work.</p>
