<p class="date">1/18/26</p>
<p>I've been waiting for Hytale for a long time. I was very excited for it when I saw the first trailer some 7 years ago, and I was very sad to hear it was cancelled 6 months ago after following it's development for so long. 2 months ago, one of the original developers successfully bought the game back from Riot, and last week, a version of the game was finally released for the public to play.</p>

<p>I didn't get a chance to play until yesterday because I've been too locked in. This last week I've been properly dedicating my afternoons to working on an animation. It took a lot of strength to hold off on playing since I've been waiting for this game for so long, but I'm glad I waited. Feels like good character development for me and also I let myself play like the whole day yesterday. It's awesome. The game is in a much better state than I was expecting. </p>
<p>I'm not sure what else to say for now. I figure I should link this funny <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/flare145.com/post/3mcn46g53mc2k" rel="noopener" target="_blank">quote tweet chain I did on Bluesky</a>. It's actually insane how happy I've been while playing this game. It really feels like I'm gonna be annoying giving this game undeserved praise but I love every aspect of it. I'm just straight up having a really good time. I know some people are annoyed at the price and to that I say, just wait. I actually think the price is justified, but this is definitely an unfinished experience. Honestly in its "final state" I think Hytale should be at least $60. People really take it for granted how cheap Minecraft is. Minecraft will always have unbeatable value because it really should be like a $100 game. Anyways if you are Microsoft please pretend you didn't hear that.</p>
<p>That's all for now. I gotta play more while it's still Sunday. See ya</p>
