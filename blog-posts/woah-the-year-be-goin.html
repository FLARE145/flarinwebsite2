<p class="date">3/15/23</p>
<p>Time is legit going by way to fast. It's already the middle of March and I haven't really gotten around to accomplishing anything I wanted to this year. Maybe if I post more, I can make sense of it all and keep better track of what I've been able to accomplish. I am by no means saying that I will post more, because I say that every post and it doesn't happen.</p>
<p>Okay lets figure things out. So lately my life has consisted of 3 things:</p>
<p>1. Work. I've been working a decent amount. Just part-time but I'm averaging 22 hours a week right now. That's a serious dent in available time for art stuff, but I also need money to fund art stuff. The vicious cycle. At least I actually really enjoy my job. It's very much a customer service job where I have to interact with a lot of different kinds of people, which is something I didn't think I would be good at. It's actually turned out to be a surprisingly rewarding job. I feel good after every positive customer interaction. I know most other people hate my job, which I guess is understandable when you're being paid minimum wage. I don't like that either, but what I'm saying is that it isn't an entirely unpleasant job. I usually don't dread clocking into work, which is something I haven't really been able to say about school.</p>
<p>2. Studying. So since the last time I've mentioned school, I've actually dropped my classes. This might seem like a horribly reckless thing to do, but it actually made plenty of sense in my situation. First, you definitely don't need a degree to get into animation. You just need solid skills and a perfect demo reel. Second, I might not even want to pursue an art job right now given the fact that AI is about to disrupt that job market. That leads to my final point, I should just get into tech. Considering I've already built several computers, have customer support experience, and have web dev experience, I feel like I would make a capable IT Support Specialist. Of course, there are still gaps in my knowledge that I am currently addressing. I'm taking Google's IT course and I will study for the CompTIA A+ after completing it. I'm taking this very seriously, so I make sure to dedicate at least 2 hours a day to it. (I tend to spend somewhere around 4 hours Mon-Thu). If I land a decent IT job, I still get to work on passion projects on the side. This is probably the best outcome for my life, I will just have to try my hardest to get that first job.</p>
<p>3. Fun Friday. Yeah so making a video every week has been a surprisingly heavy burden. It pretty much takes up all of my free time, and I doubt that the final result is something that reflects the effort I put in each week. If I end up getting a full time IT job before the end of the year, I seriously think I will have to end the streak early. I have no idea how I would manage making a video while working 40 hours a week. They have been really fun to work on at least. There's probably been two episodes where I've had more time to work on them, but chose not too. I do this when I don't feel like it. That sounds lazy but my reasoning is that if I'm not having fun making it, then it isn't a <em>fun</em> friday. Idk I might just devolve the series into shorter and shorter memes as time goes on. It would be more entertaining then whatever I'm going for right now.</p>
<p>A secret 4th thing. Gaming. I just remembered that while I'm not working on FF, I've been gaming. I think I mentioned this on the blog already, but I got game pass so I have a lot of games available to me. It's been a blast honestly. My recent computer upgrades allow me to play pretty much anything at high settings. I believe it's important to keep your spirits up and healthy, and I feel like gaming has helped me with that lately. I'll probably cancel my game pass once I've played the good games though. I don't like paying for subscriptions very much.</p>
<p>So what does this mean for all of my FLARE145 plans. Well, here's what I can conclude. FF will continue as it has been. I've exceeded my own expectations on that series and I'm proud to continue working on it. Development on my website will likely continue to be halted. Stuff like artwork commissions take priority over it. Streams will probably not return for a long time. Except maybe for DMCR icons. I don't even want to think about that though so I'm going to repress that thought again. I will probably stop everything around summertime because my hours at work will go up. Animations are on indefinite break. Maybe once I finish all my art commissions (should that ever happen). Will probably post the irregular random drawing on Twitter. This happens when I'm stressed usually. And I think that's it. </p>
<p>It really sucks that I can't be making stuff all the time, but that's just the reality of life. I hope I start to get the hang of it soon. End of lame update. Next post will be at least 1% more cool trust me. Try to be positive out there because I'm trying too</p>
