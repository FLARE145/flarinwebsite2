<p>So the 2024 Olympics happened after my last post. I really enjoy watching the Olympics, so that took up a lot of my time. I knew I was going to be watching a lot of tv, which means time not in my room working on my cool things. But, I had the idea to work on something smaller. I like doing website/code stuff on my laptop, so I decided to do a coding project. I settled for working on silly thing I came up with just a little while ago.</p>
<h3>Bro Ball Generator</h3>
<p>Recently my friends have been into these bro ball images. It's basically just a picture of a ball saying something. The ball is usually colored differently in each image. I figured this would be a fun thing to make a generator for, and it was fun.</p>

<p>I made this in about a week. I spent about a week before messing about in python. Also there were a lot of contributions from my friend Tholp after I released the first version. He added features like copying to clipboard which is very handy. Overall I'm very happy with my first project that isn't a web thing. It's still just python but oh well. I'm proud. You can check it out on <a href="https://github.com/FLARE145/broBallGenerator" rel="nopener" target="_blank">github</a>.</p>
<h3>later</h3>
<p>That's all for now. I'm hoping to work on Boxkid again soon but we'll see. See you later!</p>
