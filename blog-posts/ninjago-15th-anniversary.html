<p class="date">1/29/26</p>
<p>Somehow, I think I have never once mentioned Ninjago on this blog. This is kind of crazy because I'm actually a pretty big fan. I've been a fan since the very beginning and I guess I never grew out of it. I joke that "I gotta know how it ends" but really my ability to enjoy things has kept me hooked on the show because it's actually pretty good. It's not like peak all the time but there are some peak parts that make it worth it to certain kinds of people.</p>
<p>Lego is doing a bunch of stuff for the 15th anniversary including this <a href="https://youtu.be/XFwWcFpywyI" rel="noopener" target="_blank">cool music video</a> that features the main cast singing the original intro song. It's the kind of thing that feels like a true celebration that honestly just makes me feel good. The current show runners understand the shows strengths and that makes me happy. It makes me happy that competent people are out there putting in the effort to make cool stuff for people. Anyways, this isn't the main reason I'm making this post.</p>
<p>I have been referring to an animation project recently, but I don't remember if I've specified what it is. It kind of doesn't matter because everyone who knows me will know I'm currently slaving away at this. I'm re-animating the original Ninjago intro with the Fortnite skin versions of the characters.</p>
<p>And when I say, "slaving away," I really mean it. I have been spending most of my free time doing this (not including weekends). I work on this 20-30 minutes in the morning before going to work and 1-2 hours in the afternoon before going to bed. Today will be 1 hour because I wanted to make this post as well. The project has been easy to work on because I was able to break up the work into nice sections.</p>

<p>I don't feel like checking what day I started but it was while ago. Maybe December. I didn't start the daily hour of work until like maybe 3 weeks ago? I could verify these dates if I wanted to but I don't feel like it rn. Anyways, I just mostly finished up with Jay's scene, so I thought I would show that off here in my secluded little internet space.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, so for Kai, I just animated as I normally do which is a very unstructured method, but I took a different approach with Jay. I'm going to be working an an animation for Coaxion (TEP) and I wanted to start practicing actually blocking my scenes since the project lead wants us to work like that. So the following is how my scene progressed under this mentality. It shows the blocking stage, spline stage, and detail stage of my work.</p>

<p>I'm having fun working on this, but it is very time consuming. You may have noticed some of the physics on the dingly bits looking off, and that's because I'm animating them myself by hand. It's not too bad to do for a 24fps animation, but it is a good brain exercise. There are some groups of frames where I'm really picky about how it looks, and other parts where it doesn't matter as much so I simplify it.</p>
<p>It's slow-going but the plan is to have this mostly done before Wu and Nya skins come to Fortnite, which are pretty much confirmed. I just don't know when it will happen, so I'm working on this as much as I can. Oh yeah I just remembered I keep putting off a logo design I'm supposed to work on. I'll probably do that this weekend maybe idk.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading. I think I will talk more about Ninjago on here later because I remembered that this is my place where I can say infinite things about stuff nobody cares about. But yeah see ya</p>
