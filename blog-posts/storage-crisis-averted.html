<p>Okay the large painting files are now hosted on Google Cloud Platform. They aren't accessed often so I probably will just have to pay a couple cents every once in a while. This is the best solution for now, and probably forever honestly. Everything will now continue as normal.</p>
<p>Uhhhhh no other updates really. Just wanted to say the website is healthy once again and I officially un-declare code red. See ya</p>
