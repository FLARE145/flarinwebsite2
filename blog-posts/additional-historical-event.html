<p class="date">9/11/21</p>
<p>While I would normally wouldn't have much to say about this, today marks 20 years since the attack on the World Trade Center, so I figured I might say a few words.</p>
<p>I wasn't even born at the time, so I have no memory of the immediate fear and tragedy it caused. All I remember is that the war on terror has been going on throughout my whole life. The recent Afghanistan retreat felt so unreal to me because the U.S. has been there for literally as far back as I can remember. It sucks to know that despite that, the conflict is far from over. I pay my respects to every innocent person killed in the wake of war.</p>
<p>Sorry for the serious post. I'll get back to my typical stupid shenanigans tomorrow.</p>
