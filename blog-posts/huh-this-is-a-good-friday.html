<p class="date">3/29/24</p>
<p>Was going title this post something like good news but then I remembered it's Good Friday today. What a good name for a day. Just sounds funny. Anyways, onto the good news.</p>
<h3>Axo Plays Minecraft</h3>
<p>The first episode of Axo Plays Minecraft is complete! It's only like 20 seconds so it's no wonder it didn't take long. I'm thinking I might post it on Sunday Easter, or I might just hold onto it until I'm done with the second episode. That way there would be more to watch? Idk I'll figure it out later. Point is, this series is actually underway in a meaningful way. And I'm happy with what I've made so far.</p>
<h3>Boxkid</h3>
<p>I worked on it a bit yesterday, but generally, I've been too focused on Axo thing to work on Boxkid consistently. I still intend to continue working on both projects next week, despite being more busy at my job too. I care about both projects, and I don't feel burnt on either of them. As long as I can hold myself to my goals, it's going to be a very productive week.</p>
<p>I've had a couple weird days lately where I wasn't feeling well. I want to not be like that, especially with my goals for the future in mind. Today, I've been feeling really motivated. It's nice. I hope you all have a good day too. See you later</p>
